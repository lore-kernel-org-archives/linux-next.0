That chunk isn't part of either of the two commits above.

It is however part of commit 103566e "arm: tegra: Remove obsolete
nvidia,vbus-gpio properties" from the USB tree, so it's fine that the
change is part of linux-next.

I'm just not sure if it's expected for that chunk to show up in this
merge resolution email? If it's normal, then there's no problem; the
issue would be with me not having too much git merge conflict
resolution experience:-)
