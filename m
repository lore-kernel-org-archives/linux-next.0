Agreed. I haven't dissected the rest of the file to see if there are other 
platform bits leaking in but the filename also wraps the platform name.

Unfortunately the commit [b1148fd4 mfd: fix pcap irq bottom handler
] which modified things to loop as long as the interrupt is asserted didn't 
supply much information regarding the behavior they were trying to achieve/fix 
nor what would be the consequence of bailing earlier.

I will look at having the gpio num passed to the driver one way or another and 
will take any suggestions from Grant but without access to this hardware I am 
inclined to do as you suggest and work around things with this patch and a 
modified Kconfig , possibly making this driver depend on CONFIG_PXA_EZX.

Thanks,
