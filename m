It's not just about having generic bindings, it's also about having
bindings which have some abstraction and hope of reusability. An awful
lot of bindings are just straight dumps of Linux data structures into
the device tree which don't make a terribly great deal of sense as
bindings.

In many of these cases we'd be better off just not putting things into
the device tree in the first place, leaving things at the basic "is the
device there" stuff.
