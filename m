I still think the patches are useful. The fact that you didn't get any
comments from Michal doesn't mean that they are a bad idea, just lack
of time on the kbuild maintainer's side. It may have been a better
idea to cc LKML as well when you posted them (I for one don't follow
the kbuild list).

As for waiting times, I had patches taking even two years to get
merged. And my kbuild patch which actually introduced such warnings
had been around for nearly a year.

Now, commenting on your patches, you added a new statement, 'visible
if...' for menus. Can we not change it to something like:

-menu "I2C Algorithms"
-       depends on !I2C_HELPER_AUTO
+menu "I2C Algorithms" if !I2C_HELPER_AUTO
