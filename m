Atari SCC variants have their own quirks, so something more configurable will 
be needed.

What are the quirks the m68k mac SCC driver woukd add? From memory, I have this 
for Atari:

- hardware recovery delay for register access
- channel A/B reversed on ST ESCC
- TT channel A has 3.672 MHz RTxC, different from channel B; this is generated 
  by timer C and needs to be set up.
- TT ring indicator is wired to separate interrupt
- serial console may have initialized channel B already (ip22zilog 
  handles this).

VME needs interrupt enable in the main interrupt controller. 

Can the platform bus device code define architecture specific init callbacks to 
hide this?
