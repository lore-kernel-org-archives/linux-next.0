Oops, sorry I screwed up there. That used to get included indirectly
earlier if SPARSE_IRQ was not set.

There are patches coming to remove cpu_is_omap usage from drivers,
and until then we should just ifdef the plat/cpu.h include.

It is possible to use these kind of external PM chips with other
SoCs, they're just not omap related and that's why there drivers
have not had the Kconfig dependency. I'll post a patch for that.
