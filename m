How do you want to proceed with this conflict?

Do you want that I merged arm-soc/next/arm64 in my mvebu/defconfig64
branch before applying my patch ?

Or do you prefer that I continue to base my branch on v4.11-rc1 and then
you will take care of the conflict when pulling the branch?

Thanks,

Gregory
