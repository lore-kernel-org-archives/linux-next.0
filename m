Hi Jiri,

[ QUOTE ]
since friday's -next (the last known to be working is the last monday's)
I cannot resume from suspend. The last thing I see with
no_console_suspend is:
i915: No ACPI video bus found

But I used to see the message always, so this is no difference. Any idea
before I start bisecting?

It is x86_64, core 2 duo, intel g33 GPU, 6G RAM.
[ /QUOTE ]

Before starting any git-bisection I would try drm-intel-nightly GIT branch.
It includes drm-intel-fixes + drm-intel-next + drm-intel-next-queued
and applied here (mostly) cleanly against Linux (upstream) and/or
Linux-Next.

$ cd linux-next/

$ git pull git://people.freedesktop.org/~danvet/drm-intel drm-intel-nightly

I remember I had no problems with i915 with next-20130109 (WED) and
next-20130110 (THU), so I am curious if I will hit the problem as
well.

Kernel-config and some logs (dmesg) or hwinfos (lspci) might be helpful :-).

If this does not help, I would recommend to create diffs between
latest known (-rcX and next-X.good) and (-rcX and next-X.bad) and
compare (i915||acpi||pm) the changes.
But this also means you have to know which of the -next releases was
good and bad.
If you are building Linux-Next daily, this is good.
NOTE: Helpful is in this strategy that your -rcX should be the same
(here: v3.8-rc3).

Hope this helps you (I know bisecting Linux-Next is a bit of a pain).

Regards,
