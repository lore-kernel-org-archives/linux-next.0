It was the first change of the changes done in my branch 
https://github.com/AlexanderStein/linux/tree/gpio-compile-test
 in order to compile test as much gpio drivers as possible. Yet, pinctrl 
drivers were out of my scope.

Why not depend PINCTRL_IPROC_GPIO on CONFIG_OF as Randy stated 
pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map_pin and friends are only present if CONFIG_OF 
is enabled. Depending on OF_GPIO only is enough under the assumption a) you 
made below.
Also what about providing dummy implementation for those missing function in 
case CONFIG_OF is disabled, my preference as more code can be compile tested.

or if COMPILE_TEST is enabled

I think a problem in this and possibly other cases is that COMPILE_TEST 
loosens the Kconfig dependencies to some degree. How to proceed? Allow compile 
testing drivers only if some optional settings are enabled?

Best regards,
