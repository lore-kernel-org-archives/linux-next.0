Hi all,

linux-m68k.git is back, in the usual place:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=3Dlinux/kernel/git/geert/linux-m68k.git

Interesting branches:
  - master: main development, containing accepted changesets,
  - m68k-queue: (almost) identical to master, but nice changesets
rebased on top of
    the latest v* tag (incl. release candidates) from Linus (I don't
follow stable),
  - for-linus: What I will ask Linus to pull in this merge window,
  - for-next: What's destined for the next merge window,
  - for-*: What's destined for a specific merge window. The latest over=
lap with
    for-linus/for-next,
  - m68k-v*: State of m68k-queue when v* was current.

master and m68k-v* are never rebased. m68k-queue and for-* are rebased =
when a
new v* comes out.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
