Thanks Stephen, this should be a trivial conflict. Also you wrote one
of the patches :)

Question, what is the best way to merge dependent patches? Considering
they will need a good amount of architecture testing, I think they will
have to go via arch trees. But it also does not make sense to merge these
kbuild changes upstream first, without having tested them.

Thanks,
Nick
