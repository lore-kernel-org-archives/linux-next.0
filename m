Well, my patch made matching of platform devices to platform drivers
more strict. Your machine relies on the respective binding though. So o=
f
course reverting my patch "repairs" your machine, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that my patch is wrong. Even though I'm convinced in
the meantime by Russell that there are false positives it doesn't
necessarily imply that your case is such a false positive, too.

One example of a combination of driver + device I intended to break wit=
h
my patch was drivers/mtd/nand/mxc_nand.c and devices that got bound to
that by name. The driver does:

	const struct of_device_id *of_id =3D
		of_match_device(mxcnd_dt_ids, host->dev);

and doesn't handle of_id being NULL after that. Some people argued (als=
o
for other drivers in similar situations) that this cannot happen becaus=
e
all compatibles had a non-NULL device_id. That is an error that is easy
to make and so the idea was to just not bind in such a case and safe th=
e
user from the surprise.
