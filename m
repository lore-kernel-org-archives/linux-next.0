OK -- but the situation is breaking OF-based drivers on ARM platforms
today.

Based on what you've suggested, does the following policy sound
reasonable for resolving that deadlock?


1) All OF code and drivers should be migrating to use 0 instead of NO_IRQ
   for the no-interrupt case.  Code which receives irq numbers directly
   from the OF framework and refers to NO_IRQ, or expects 0 to be a valid
   needs to be fixed.

2) Where we hit a problem, board code needs to be adapted to remap HW IRQs
   0-15 to different software values.  (This could be done using irq
   domains, or not)


I'm still not sure what the correct approach is for drivers which get
irq numbers from OF indirectly -- this particularly applies to platform
and AMBA devices.

If we expect board code to start populating platform data based on 
information from the OF code, we need to fix the board not to use linux
irq 0 to describe a real HW interrupt, if it matters (as in (2)).

AMBA devices registered via of_platform_populate() already get their
irq numbers from OF.  So long as OF used to explicitly return NO_IRQ
there was no problem -- but if OF is moving to return 0 instead, we have
a potential problem for each AMBA driver which may be used by a board
which can boot without DT... if we have any scenarios where that driver
is given real irq 0.

Maybe we can fix these breakages as they occur -- I don't really know
the scale of the impact.


What are your thoughts on this?
