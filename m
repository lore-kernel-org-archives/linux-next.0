Does it have to be papered over in the kernel though?

We can only guarantee one thing - ABI. And that is kept intact. But I
literally have no idea if a kernel breaks a random program out there
that happens to have a bug.

We have 3 options now:

1. Never change KEY_MAX and dont add any new key definitions.
2. Introduce a new ioctl and have all wel-behaving programs rewritten
   to support it.
3. Fix userspace driver (patch is available).

Gioventhe fact that I wanted that change to go when .28 opens and it
will really hit users in 6+ months I'd still like to have 3.
