Not just ARM:

And it's not just definitions of NO_IRQ. These are easy to find.
On some archs (notably ARM) zero still seems to be a valid IRQ number,
e.g. IRQ_LOCOMO_KEY and IRQ_DMA0C0.

Also, UML has TIMER_IRQ being zero.

A quick grep found many more IRQ definitions being zero, but
surprisingly the few
I looked into were definitions without users (e.g. SE7343_FPGA_IRQ_MRSH=
PC0,
ROUTE_VIA_IRQ0 aka IRQ_MB93493_VDC_ROUTE).

Perhaps request_irq() should just reject zero to find all of them?
