You introduced a build regression by moving the #include <asm-generic/s=
iginfo.h>
to the bottom of arch/m68k/include/asm/siginfo.h.

After fixing that (patch below, did gmail webmail preserve the tabs?),
atari_defconfig builds
and runs on ARAnyM. I'm now building a sun3_defconfig...

I guess you forgot to check out branch fix-includes? There's no unistd_=
mm.h in
that branch.
