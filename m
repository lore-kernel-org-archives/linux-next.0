Maybe I am wrong, but doesn't conf_write() actually take care of this
when it does that sym_calc_value() for all the symbols? Or maybe
that's the problem (i.e. that it doesn't).

Current satconfig code can be changed to produce random configs (that
nevertheless respect the user's choices) with a 1-line patch. But
there are some other issues to be worked out, mainly that conf_write()
doesn't respect all the choices that the SAT solver made. There could
be several reasons for that: 1. satconfig doesn't deal with
hex/int/string values and relies on conf_write() to fill in those
(this is a plain old bug), 2. the translation into boolean logic is
subtly wrong, perhaps a corner case or something like that, and/or 3.
conf_write() does something wrong.

I'll be happy to give a tour of the satconfig code if you or anybody
else would like to start hacking on it.
