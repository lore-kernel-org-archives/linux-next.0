No, I think the previous structure was just "lucky" in that it just
happened to be the right alignment.  I say this as I think I was the on=
e
who created that structure years ago.  Or maybe not, this was back in
the 2.3 kernel days, I can't remember what patches I wrote last week...

Hopefully not, if you add another field here, the alignment force will
keep things lined up properly, from what I can tell.  Is that not true?

C doesn't require the structure to be aligned.  Actually the spec says
it doesn't guarantee anything about this, we just "know" that gcc is
going to be semi-sane and try to do the best it can.  Hopefully clang i=
s
also semi-sane as well.

So because of that, we have to give it some guidance, hence the patch.
