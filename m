Hi Grant,

If I understand you correctly, the non-overlapping memory regions thing
could be a problem for me. We have a Meta based SoC that has various SoC
registers grouped together for doing GPIOs and Pin control things. I'm
still in the process of converting it to device tree, but the way I've
been handling it is to provide overlapping registers to both the gpio
and pinctl DT nodes. Each GPIO bank's registers are also interleaved
with the others, so I've been providing overlapping register ranges
(offset by 4 for each bank) to the DT node for each gpio bank too, so
each bank can function independently and the driver doesn't have to
worry about multiple banks. Does that sound like a reasonable use case?

I guess I could cheat with the length, or specify each register in it's
own memory resource, but it seems like overkill.

Cheers
James
