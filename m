Uck, no!

Moorestown does not have legacy hardware (i8042, i8259) and does not
like legacy ports being poked by drivers. Instead of playing with
Kconfig selections let's check if we set up dummy (null) legacy PIC
during startup and abort i8042 initialization as well. This should
fix the following bug:
	----

The presence of 8042 and 8259 are orthogonal.  In fact, there are quite
a few systems on the market which have 8259 but not 8042, and at least
having the ability to handle that correctly instead of just assuming
that those I/O ports are safe is pretty key.

So please don't commingle these completely unrelated platform attributes.
