It's a fairly big chunk of code and I suspect a fair few of our users
(all the light sensors for starters) won't want it at all.  If anything
I'm keen to do a bit of reorganization of other bits of the core to
further cut down on the minimum present.

Move relevant functions out as needed or put stubs in place.  Perhaps we
can revisiting this question down the line, but I don't think we want to
make buffer support obligatory at the moment.
