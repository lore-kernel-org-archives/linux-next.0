Here we don't extend the interface though.

Because X proper, HAL, DirectFB and many other users got it right and
changing it to mean bits would break _them_.

I guess that means that we have to have that patch that spits warning
and reduces size of returned data of it detects 01ff buffer size.
Still, its uuuuugllllyyy.

That is bigger topic. HID spec has much more events for differect
things though. FOr example the new key definitions for the phones - we
want to have a separate # key and not try to combine "shift" and "3"
and also have separate numeric keys taht don't depend on register and
NumLock state. If we don't have such keycodes we have trouble with
some european users that have numbers in upper register...
