A different point: should *anyone* be rebasing commits that they did not
themselves commit.  Discuss.

IMHO no - the commits were made public, and anyone could pull the tree
from which they came in order to do further work before submitting that.
Rebasing changes the commit IDs, which can lead to duplicate commits
ending up in mainline.  With other changes on top, this causes totally
unnecessary conflicts.
