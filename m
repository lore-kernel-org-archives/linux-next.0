They look good.  I have added the for-linus branch as my m68k-current
tree and changed my m68k tree over to the for-next branch.

That's fine as long as the commits in the for-next branch are: posted
somewhere relevant, reviewed, tested and destined for the next merge
window. (None of these requirements have changed from what should have
been in your quilt tree.)

I expect the for-linus branch to be fixes and stuff for the current
release.
