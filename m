|  No, but that's an interesting observation, thank you -- well spotted!  
| 
|  ExtINTA stands for an "External INTA cycle" which is passed through from
| the CPU down to the system bus instead of being intercepted by the local
| APIC unit as usually.  In response to the INTA cycle one of the 8259A
| chips (either the master or the slave, depending on the source of the
| interrupt selected for handling) supplies the vector directly to the CPU
| through PCI (or whatever kind of bus links the legacy bridge with the host
| bridge) and then the FSB.  Therefore the vector bypasses all the APIC
| circuitry and cannot result in an APIC error interrupt.
| 
|  Instead the message quoted means an APIC input is misprogrammed
| somewhere.  This error happens if an interrupt is signalled to an unmasked
| APIC input which uses the Fixed or Lowest-Priority delivery mode and its
| vector implies priority below the minimum permitted, that is in the range
| from 0 to 15.
| 
|  We have code already in place in io_apic_{32,64}.c that can be used to
| find out the offender with a piece of code like this (#if 0 has to be
| deactivated for this to work and they may be bit rot bugs to be fixed):
| 
| int __init all_pic_dump(void)
| {
| 	int v = apic_verbosity;
| 
| 	apic_verbosity = APIC_DEBUG;
| 	print_IO_APIC();
| 	print_all_local_APICs();
| 	print_PIC();
| 	apic_verbosity = v;
| 
| 	return 0;
| }
| 
| late_initcall(all_pic_dump);
| 
| if somebody is willing to aid with debugging this problem.

Thanks, Maciej,

i would really like to help... but I can't even hit this
bug on my laptop :(
