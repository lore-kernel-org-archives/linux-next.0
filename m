Does it always do that, or was it just this time? It's setup to=20
word-wrap, for instance this paragraph should. I have an add-on, which=20

The frequency is already a generic binding, it's the others which need=20

I didn't say it was hard, I was it was time consuming. It would require=
=20
looking at all of the other drivers and picking out bits which are the=20
same. An i2c guy would be better to do it. I didn't even know what the=20
nmk-i2c ones were (slsu, tft, rft, sm) until I was told my the author. =

fear the other drivers will be just as cryptic.

I'm not a vendor. I also keep my promises. :)
