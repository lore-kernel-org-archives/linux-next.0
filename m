Thanks for taking care (my latest experiences on LKML/linux-next tell
me even this is no more the fact!)!

Your patch finally hit Linux-Next (next-20130116) and IIRC it is also
marked for previous Linux-kernel releases (CC -stable).
I have tested your patch as said also against Linux v3.8-rcX.

Unfortunately, the applied patch in Linux-Next does not contain any of
my desired Reported-by/Tested-by.
This makes me a bit unhappy, but I do NOT insist on it.

Mr. Torvalds himself pointed several times to all maintainers to
honour people - even they report and ideally report-and-test!

I am doing all my testings in my free-time and I am not paid for it.
I am raping my hardware here!
I can't do more than that!
