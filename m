 I don't recall seeing a note that my patch was reverted.  I had a careful
look at yours now and it applies on top of some diagnostic code which
should never have been applied to the tree in the first place as it was
not meant to and would also break the majority of systems out there.  I am
fairly sure this piece of code is the reason my implementation of the
workaround did not work for you.

 It does, thanks.  However I insist on getting this issue dealt with the
way I proposed -- check_timer() is too complicated and too fragile to mess
with as our history has already shown.  If IRQ0 is not to be routed
through the I/O APIC, then it should never be registered as an I/O APIC
interrupt in the first place.

 I am fairly with the offending change removed my fix will work for you as
expected as I went through the effort of checking at the run time that
once activated it makes the kernel correctly avoid the sequence in
check_timer() that hits your system, so it is only the DMI ID matching
that could have gone wrong, but your change indicates this is actually not
the case.
