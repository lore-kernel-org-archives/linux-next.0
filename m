Huh, I thought all the trees are doing this already. Well, that explains
where the the problem comes from. :)

In any case, drm-misc, drm-rust and drm-intel already have for-linux-next a=
nd
for-linux-next-fixes, and the implementation is generic. So, adding it to x=
e and
amd is trivial.

That's what drm-misc, drm-rust and drm-intel promise, yes.

Something like dim request-pull --final seems like a reasonable helper to m=
e.

I think for this part isn't different; tip/for-linux-next just merges one o=
r the
other.

Which extra build time and conflict resolution? You have two tip trees in e=
ither
case, no? One that contains $tree/$tree-next and one that doesn't.

I don't mind doing this. :)

Interesting, why is that? It seems to work perfectly fine in drm-misc, drm-=
rust
and drm-intel.

The only thing maintainers need to do is push $tree-next to $tree-next-fixe=
s at
the cutoff. The rest is automatically handled by dim already.

Where is this happening?

I think if xe and amd would have those branches there'd not be a problem to
begin with.

But independent of that, I think it is nice to give the "fully merge confli=
ct
resolved thing" to Mark. :)
