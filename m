Another option is to make the top-level option negative, that way when it's
enabled by allmod/yes the plugins are turned off.

So eg. you would have:

config DISABLE_GCC_PLUGINS
	bool "Disable building GCC plugins"
	default y
	...
	
This makes all the problems with allmod/yes go away, and means you always honor
the users intent - when DISABLE_GCC_PLUGINS=n you can fail the build if you
can't build the plugins.

The downside is the logic's a bit awkward, ie. to enable the plugins you have to
disable the option which disables them.

cheers
