My intention was to compile test (device tree) drivers also without CONFIG_OF 
which is disabled by defconfig default on arch/x86/configs/*

That seems sensible. If we can agree that anyone who wants to compile test 
drivers has to enable CONFIG_OF even it is not needed for the current 
configuration.
