It is not extremely bad, but it is at the minimum surprising.

I see, I had not noticed those before. They do seem a little unusual,
and inconsistent, as the samsung sames are always names the board
there, but rockchip doesn't: one board names it just "I2C", the other
one uses "VEYRON-I2S", and the example in the documentation lists
"ROCKCHIP-I2S" and "Analog audio output", each of them following
different naming systems.

In Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/qcom,apq8096.txt, a
"qcom,model" property is listeds as "Obsolete", and replaced by
a "model" property. This is in turn also used on amlogic, freescale,
and some samsung platforms.

My impression here is that the idea of passing a model name
through DT is well established, but for new stuff, we probably
want to standardize on plain "model" rather than "$vendor,model".
