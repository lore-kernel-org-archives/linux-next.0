Ah, I looked at the wrong branch and didn't see that I applied a patch
instead of a pull request. It's all fine then, as long as you never
intend to send any pull requests based on top of your current branch.

You can possibly make Stephen's life a tiny bit simpler if you just
drop all patches from your for-next branch as soon as we've picked
them up into arm-soc.
