I don't think they should use struct dev_pin_info at all,
that thing is for the device core only.

I like to think that <linux/pinctrl/consumer.h> is for drivers that
explicitly grab and control pin control states so this driver should
only include <linux/pinctrl/consumer.h>.

Torvalds: can you do it like that instead? Either way will
make the compile work again, we can also tidy it up later.
(i.e. I will grep for includes of pinctrl/dev_info.h and replace
it with consumer.h) at some point.

It wasn't pretty that these drivers were relying on implicit
#includes in the first place so either is anyway prettier than
what it used to look like.

In a way I kind of like this sideffect even if it broke some
compiles.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
