+	  - source include statments should be changed from autofs_fs4.h to
+	    autofs_fs.h since these two header file have been merged.
+	  - user space scripts that manually load autofs4.ko should be changed
+	    to load autofs.ko. Since the module directory name and the module
+	    name itself are the same now there is no need to manually load

+	  - any "alias autofs autofs4" will need to be removed.

+	  Please configure AUTOFS_FS instead of AUTOFS4_FS from now on.
