Thanks, which version of Fedora are you running?

Your case is more straightforward in that you're clearly using bio-based
DM linear (which was updated to leverage "noclone" support); whereas the
s390 case is using request-based DM which isn't impacted by the commit
in question at all.

I'll attempt to reproduce first thing Monday.
