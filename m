When CONFIG_BLOCK is not enabled:

In file included from next-2011-1011/drivers/mmc/card/sdio_uart.c:43:0:
next-2011-1011/include/linux/mmc/card.h:175:12: error: 'DISK_NAME_LEN' undeclared here (not in a function)

Deleting the #include <linux/mmc/card.h> fixes the sdio_uart.c build.
However, the same problem occurs in mmc/core/core.c:

In file included from next-2011-1011/drivers/mmc/core/core.c:30:0:
next-2011-1011/include/linux/mmc/card.h:175:12: error: 'DISK_NAME_LEN' undeclared here (not in a function)

Should mmc/core/ depend on BLOCK?  or should it just be made
to build even when BLOCK is not enabled?
