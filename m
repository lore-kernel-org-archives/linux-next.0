 I have had a look at the tree and there are two commits containing
diagnostic code that should have never been applied to the tree.  Their 
IDs in the linux-next tree are as follows:

90221a61a71b7ad659d8741cf1e404506b174982
a74a1cc3df0be89658bc735c8aed80c8392e2c15

Please revert them both.  Thanks.

  Maciej
