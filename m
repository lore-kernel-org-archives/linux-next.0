would defining page variable to unsigned long long solve it for x86_32?

That would still not fix the wrong error-info reported by the driver - =
this is
fixed by the patch-set titled '[RFC PATCH 2.6.37 0/4] i3000_edac : merg=
e
i82975x support' dated 2011-02-14 in the linux-edac archives.

Please advise on getting the patch into main-stream. The I3000 is a re-=
labeled
i82975x (or vice-versa). Hence the patch-set to merge the drivers. If s=
eparate
i82975x driver is needed - I can provide the patch. The reported bug is=
 not
present in the merge-patched driver.

Thanks,
Arvind.
