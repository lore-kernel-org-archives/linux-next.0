That is what will be the next version.
But two days ago, there was no IGD working driver and ThinkPads did not work 
with an IGD graphics device and video.ko without your dri extensions. In fact 
this was the "regression" (in fact it never worked) that blocked the "do not 
let the video driver poke on graphics devices for which no graphics card is 
plugged in" (Patch 1/2).

So there was a need for this.
In fact, my next version will still use thinkpad_acpi by default.
But this one will be based on a dmi blacklist. You mentioned ThinkPad BIOSes 
which are missing a specific function and cannot work with IGD? Please adjust 
the blacklist then to match those.

This has nothing to do with OS.
Just give vendors/BIOS developers the possibility to check whether the OS is 
capable of Opregion video support.
This is not necessary as long as Linux returns true for Windows strings.
There we cannot differ for  individual OSI features anyway.
But if we do not do it correct now, we will close the door to be spec 
compatible forever.

Thanks,
