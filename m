So, this originally came about because I pushed back on adding random
dependencies like this for features which are pretty much optional in
drivers - their use of GPIOs is totally optional and the dependencies
are just too fragile, leading to noise with all the randconfigs.  It
seems better to get the architectures to keep up with enhancements to
gpiolib (or convert to it) than to have to worry about this in drivers.

That's more a result of it being a pretty new feature than anything else
I think.
