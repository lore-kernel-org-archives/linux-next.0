From: Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>

 Some HP laptops have a problem with their DSDT reporting as
HP/SB400/10000, which includes some code which overrides all temperature
trip points to 16C if the INTIN2 input of the I/O APIC is enabled.  This
input is incorrectly designated the ISA IRQ 0 via an interrupt source
override even though it is wired to the output of the master 8259A and
INTIN0 is not connected at all.  So far two models have been identified, 
namely nx6125 and nx6325.

 Use a knob provided by the I/O APIC interrupt registration code to
abandon any attempts to route IRQ 0 through the I/O APIC for these
systems.

Hello,

 Matthew, you have not added your sign-off with the original patch, please 
do so now.

 Rafael, please try this change together with 
patch-2.6.26-rc1-20080505-mpparse-acpi-noirq0-2 and see if this fixes your 
system.

 I have tried the patches with a wildcard entry added to acpi_dmi_table[]
so that it trips for my system.  The result is as follows:

ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=-1 pin1=-1 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ... works.

(note the absence of any timer pin), which means the changes work as
expected.  Here the timer has been set up as a native local APIC interrupt
routed through the 8259A set up as a "virtual wire".

 Ingo, please apply the two patches where appropriate.

  Maciej
