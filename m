Hi Randy, Andrei.

I suggest third option for this.
As you know, MMC like ATA Driver and SCSI Driver etc.. can not enable
without CONFIG_BLOCK
So I think that mmc should be depended from CONFIG_BLOCK like other
block device driver.
see the their Kconfig. How do you think ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------------------------------------------
menuconfig ATA
        tristate "Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers"
        depends on HAS_IOMEM
        depends on BLOCK
        depends on !(M32R || M68K) || BROKEN


config SCSI
        tristate "SCSI device support"
        depends on BLOCK
        select SCSI_DMA if HAS_DMA
        ---help---
