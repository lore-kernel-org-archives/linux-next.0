Right. My recollection of this is somewhat hazy, so here's something I 
wrote a couple of years ago:

"If you dig through the DSDT code for the 6125, you'll find a bit where 
it writes 0x14 to 0xfec00000 and then checks whether offset 0x12 from 
there is 1. In other words, it's checking if pin 2 of the io-apic is 
masked. If it's not masked (that is, offset 0x12 is 0 and irq 2 is 
enabled) it sets another bit in a register. This is then checked by the 
thermal zone code which as a result sets the thermal trip temperatures 
to 16 degrees Celsius. This bites when the acpi_skip_timer_override 
option is used in Linux."

I have no idea what this code is for, but it's pretty clear that Windows 
sets it up in such a way that this isn't true.
