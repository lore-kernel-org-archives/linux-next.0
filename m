Well, I thought of this solution, but I don't like it, as it makes
the whole thing very fragile and sensitive to the reg-userspace-consumer
platform device registration order and count, isn't it?
(That's why I proposed to use NULL...).

So, Mark, how do you think the above issues can be handled without
putting NULL into the dev_name?
