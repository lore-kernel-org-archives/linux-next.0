Do you know Dells working with the video.ko driver?

If you tell me video.ko, best with an IGD device and without one is working 
there, it can be removed. Even then talking with dcdbas developers how to 
inform their user space app first is a good idea.

As Dell is cooking their own soup here and the dcdbas driver was reported to 
work correctly with ACPI brightness functions in BIOS it is ok to blacklist 
Dells here until the first test reports are coming in telling us that 
video.ko is actually working correctly there.
Testing will be easy via boot param.

I will not risk again that this whole bunch of our patches will be reverted 
on -rc6 again, because a Dell user is reporting a backlight regression.
We then have the same situation we had when the "check for physical device was 
removed": The implementation is wrong but worked. The implementation is 
right, but does not work on a specific machine -> regression -> revert.
