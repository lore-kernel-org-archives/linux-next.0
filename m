Thanks for testing.

But so you and others are aware: based on further internal discussion
with Mikulas, I decided to drop all the bio-based DM "noclone" changes
that were developed for 5.1.

Mikulas had a really good point that the 10-13% performance benefit seen
with 512b IO workloads all but disappears to only a 1% improvement as
soon as the bio's payload is increased to >= 4K.  Meaning the risk
associated with the noclone changes really is _not_ worth the reward.

I've rebased the dm-5.1 branch accordingly and linux-next will pick it
up tonight.

Mike

ps. in case anyone cares, the noclone changes have been preserved in
this dm-noclone-support branch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=dm-noclone-support
