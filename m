Thanks.  That patch has rather a blooper if
CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP=n.  Is that the case in your testing?

Arnd's tentative fix is below.

I shall drop that patchset for now.

Subject: mm/page_alloc.c: set a zone_start_pfn value in zone_spanned_pages_in_node

We got a new build warning in linux-next:

mm/page_alloc.c: In function 'free_area_init_node':
mm/page_alloc.c:5278:25: warning: 'zone_start_pfn' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
    zone->zone_start_pfn = zone_start_pfn;
mm/page_alloc.c:5265:17: note: 'zone_start_pfn' was declared here
   unsigned long zone_start_pfn, zone_end_pfn;

The code indeed looks wrong, but this is just a guess of what the
fix might be: I have not looked it in detail, so please treat this
as a bug report.
