No, I only reverted -- I didn't pull in any new branch.

I wonder if this mess is caused by the fact that I did the revert
instead of rebuilding our for-next and dropping the merge in the first

I'll rebuild our for-next (or maybe Arnd will beat me to it) before
next linux-next build, i.e. Sunday night my time.
