Commit d0db84e ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Fix 6pin mux configuration

changed a line within omap_mcbsp_6pin_src_mux() function to fix an erro=
r which
prevents the mux configuration in 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 kernels.

Commit 8fef626 ARM/ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Remove CLKR/FSR mux configuration =
code

should remove this function fir 3.7 and the mux configuration should be=
 done
in the board files or via DTS.

You have reported when you applied the McBSP DT series that commit 8fef=
626 had
conflict when you applied it. This was because I have created the serie=
s on on
a branch where the 6pin function was already fixed since I knew it is g=
oing to
be in 3.6 when the 3.7 merge will open.

So how can we resolve this?
Are you going to rebase or update your 3.7, for-next topic/omap branche=
s on
mainline so they will contain the mainline patch (d0db84e)?
Not sure if I mentioned it but I have created a branch (for you to take=
, or
observe):
git://gitorious.org/omap-audio/linux-audio.git peter/topic/for-mark/oma=
p-3.7

Here I have your topic/omap branch rebased on mainline and I have fixed=
 the
commit 8fef626 and added the missing chunk in order to avoid build fail=
ure.

A patch against your 3.7, for-next, topic/omap will not apply in linux-=
next
and a patch on top of linux-next would not apply in the asoc tree.

Please let me know how can I help to resolve this - I do not want 3.7-r=
c1 to
be broken when it comes out for OMAP audio.

Thank you,
P=E9ter
