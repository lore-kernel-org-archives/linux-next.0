Didn't seem too many of those in drivers/serial ...

According to my 2.2.25 source, SCC A is at interrupt number 33, SCC B is at 34. 
Did that change with tha A/UX interrupt style? 
What seems to be true is all interrupt types for a given channel go to the same 
handler...

The platform device would need to have one interrupt number each for TX, RX, 
status and special condition for each channel, plus data/control ports forr 
each, plus flags. The Mac platform device would have only one interrupt per 
channel (and perhaps a flag indicating that).

Right you are ...

Are there any Macs with builtin modems in the standard configuration?

This is on AV Macs only (because the PSC interrupts are at 32-35 there)?

I don't think using callbacks would be a clean way of handling this, so your 
idea may be better. 

VME and Atari used to use the same driver in 2.2 so that should still be 
possible now.
