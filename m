Because linux/genhd is now included, oops. I'm pretty positive this is due to the "mmc : general purpose partition support" patch pulled recently. I am adding NamJae, who was the author.

I don't think there should be a direct dependency on BLOCK. I have two suggestions -
1) Have our own define similar to (and in fact smaller):
   linux/genhd.h:#define DISK_NAME_LEN                     32
2) Put the MMC physical partition code under an #ifdef CONFIG_BLOCK, which is a reasonable
   proposition, given that there wouldn't be any need to parse physical partition info if
   it would never be consumed by the MMC block driver.

Thoughts?
