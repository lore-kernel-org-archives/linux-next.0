I do agree. Especially since we never got any input on whether it works or not.

Yeah, I'd like to just remove NO_IRQ from the OF paths. Afaik, it
hasn't worked as NO_IRQ before anyway, so even if the rest of the
drivers end up continuing using NO_IRQ, the OF-enabled ones on ARM
should just stop. There can't be many of those yet.
