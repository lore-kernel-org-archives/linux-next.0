This is what is documented:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/smsc-lan91c111.txt
- reg-io-width : Mask of sizes (in bytes) of the IO accesses that
  are supported on the device.  Valid value for SMSC LAN91c111 are
  1, 2 or 4.  If it's omitted or invalid, the size would be 2 meaning
  16-bit access only.

and this appears to match what the driver does, although it is a
rather unconventional definition (I would have expected an array
of widths in bytes).

Almost all of the users leave out the property, so they get 16-bit
access, nomadik-nhk15 is the only one that actually specifies
the width explicitly, and it also requests 16-bit only. I don't
think your patch changes anything for these cases.
