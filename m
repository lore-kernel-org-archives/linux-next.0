So, I think I figured out what you're talking about here.  Check -next.
Please if you're going to do stuff like this in future:

 - Talk about the actual code we've got.  It's OK to explain the history
   but it's very important to explain the concrete problem - that was
   missing from your mails (the closest we got was "compilation problem").

 - Discuss changes to what's there, starting off with "let's throw
   everything away" doesn't help with clarity especially with a missing
   problem description.

The problem description is especially critical.
