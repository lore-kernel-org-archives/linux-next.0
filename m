It still feels a bit artificial to impose that limitation on something
that is supposed to be implementation independent. Having said that it
doesn't particularly bother me having to work around it.

Something like this works quite nicely for me and keeps the driver code
nice and simple (iterates over children a bit like I2C, no need for
gpio-cells=3). I'd welcome comments:

		gpios: gpios@02005800 {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "img,tz1090-gpio";
			reg = <0x02005800 0x90>;

			gpios0: bank@0 {
				#gpio-cells = <2>;
				#interrupt-cells = <2>;
				reg = <0>;
				interrupts = <13 4 /* level */>;
				gpio-controller;
				gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 0 30>;
				interrupt-controller;
			};
			gpios1: bank@1 {
				#gpio-cells = <2>;
				#interrupt-cells = <2>;
				reg = <1>;
				interrupts = <14 4 /* level */>;
				gpio-controller;
				gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 30 30>;
				interrupt-controller;
			};
			gpios2: bank@2 {
				#gpio-cells = <2>;
				#interrupt-cells = <2>;
				reg = <2>;
				interrupts = <15 4 /* level */>;
				gpio-controller;
				gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 60 30>;
				interrupt-controller;
			};
		};

Cheers
