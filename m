We've been hitting this in Fedora on particularly UP kernel builds. I
also came to the same conclusions that you did (see Google+) and had a
chat with Arnd about it. A test build with the __per_cpu_* data removed
from the linker vmlinux.lds succeeds in building for the reasons cited.
That's not to say that was the intended fix, just an experiment to
confirm that this is the problem we've been hitting on some builds.

The "problem" is that kallsyms uses a "compression" algorithm that
derives the name compressed from the type+symbol_name so
"T__per_cpu_start" becomes "D__per_cpu_start". The compression is very
trivial in that unused characters in the set of input symbols are used
to represent popular character pairs, etc. So when the symbol changes
type according to nm output (as you explain), the size of kallsyms_names
will likely change, changing all the offsets. I was going to report this
either this evening or in the morning, but I have been waiting for some
tests to complete. Glad you found it.

As to longer term, I am happy to work up something that will spot this
particular kind of failure (symbol changes type) and output something
more useful during the kallsyms generation if you would like.

Are you planning to pull in either of the fixes you mention?

Jon.
