Hmm... interesting, it doesn't apply on linux-next. The reason for that is 
that the code on linux-next is different from the one on the tip of the branch 
that I sent to Michal. The difference explains the crash too and why I thought 
it was impossible.

Michal, looks like you missed applying patch #28 "Add current selection 
check." from the original series. It's one of three commits that don't start 
with "Port xconfig to Qt5", so I guess it was  missed. It's the only commit 
missing (you applied 38 and the series had 39).
