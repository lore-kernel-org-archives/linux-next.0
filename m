Okay, I see.

Regarding the topic bug. Completely untested patch is below. Could anybody
check if it helps?

Subject: [PATCH] arm: define __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED for !LPAE

ARM uses custom implementation of PMD folding in 2-level page table case.
Generic code expects to see __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED to be defined if PMD is
folded, but ARM doesn't do this. Let's fix it.

Defining __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED will drop out unused __pmd_alloc().
It also fixes problems with recently-introduced pmd accounting on ARM
without LPAE.
