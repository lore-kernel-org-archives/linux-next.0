Ok.
I just got a report that Dells must not use the video driver:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=404627

They have a really ugly dcdbas driver which issues SMIs triggered from 
userspace.
Hmm, to do it correctly, I have to match against the alias of the dcdbas 
driver:
MODULE_ALIAS("dmi:*:[bs]vnD[Ee][Ll][Ll]*:*");
but matching for Dell should be enough.

Also not nice is that the video driver probably should not be loaded at all in 
this case.
Hmm, maybe I should check for !video_backlight_support 
&& !video_display_output_support and then do not load the video driver at 
all, it shouldn't have any functionality then, not sure...
