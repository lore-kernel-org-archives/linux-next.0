Maybe it would be a good idea that Uwe creates a patch which initially
warns when a DT platform device falls back to matching via the platform
strings?

It's likely that the "basic subsystem" platform drivers are silent when
they probe, so having notification of a fallback would at least put
something into the kernel log when that happens - and then later change
that to be a hard failure (as Uwe is trying to do with his patch.)

However, I have to bring up another point: is what Uwe is trying to do
actually the right thing?  The DT platform device code has the ability
to create standard platform devices from DT, with an of_node, but with
standard names, and platform data.  It's there for compatibility with
older systems, and is there to allow systems to be transitioned over.

This patch breaks all that: despite the DT code changing the platform
device bus_id from the address.nodename format to the standard format
(thus allowing unconverted platform drivers to match), this patch
means that because the platform device has a of_node attached, this
will now fail.

Therefore, I think Uwe's patch is just wrong - or, if it's something we
want, the auxdata table support code needs to _also_ be ripped out of
the drivers/of/platform.c code, but that then means anyone who wants to
go through the conversion has a big flag-day change to go through.
