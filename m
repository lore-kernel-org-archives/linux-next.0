Hi Guenter,

I'm currently mailing out v2 of the series which should fix your
problem. It was an issue where the kernel would check the FP context for
whether a SIGFPE should be generated even in cases where FP had not been
used by userland, and thus had not been initialised. My userland is
hard float & thus makes use of the FPU early whilst I believe yours is
soft float, which explains the difference in behaviour.

I think the endian difference probably boils down to what garbage the
initial FP context contained.

Ralf: can you update the patches in -next please?

Thanks,
    Paul
