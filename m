Here is what I meant when I said in my v2 comment that there was
naming overlap, and that I wasn't sure what impact that had.

The two consumers are:

static struct platform_device em_x270_gps_userspace_consumer = {
        .name           = "reg-userspace-consumer",
        .id             = 0,
        .dev            = {
                .platform_data = &em_x270_gps_consumer_data,
        },
};

and 

static struct platform_device em_x270_gprs_userspace_consumer = {
        .name           = "reg-userspace-consumer",
        .id             = 1,
        .dev            = {
                .platform_data = &em_x270_gprs_consumer_data,
        }
};

Note that the existing names currently don't incorporate the .id
field as a suffix, and so never were unique.

Paul.
