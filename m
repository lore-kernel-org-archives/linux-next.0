And if you guarantee not to rebase the kbuild tree (or at least the
subset containing these patches), then each of the architecture trees
can just merge your tree (or a tag?) and then implement any necessary
arch dependent changes.  I fixes are necessary, they can also be merged
into the architecture trees.
