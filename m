Confirmed.

However now I'm getting device-mapper errors on 'cryptsetup create':

dmesg:
...
device-mapper: core: bdget failed in dm_suspend
device-mapper: ioctl: device doesn't appear to be in the dev hash table.
...

cryptsetup:
...
Command failed: device-mapper: resume ioctl failed: Invalid argument
...

next-20080826 is fine

BTW it also seems that certain people need some encouragement
to fix the nasty warning first reported by Randy two weeks ago
(http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/8/14/207) and later addressed by
Rusty (http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/8/16/40) (the solution is said
to be fragile but there doesn't seem to be any better one on
the horizon so...)
