At least for DT enabled platforms, we could force "no irq" to be 0 in
the DT irq code. Searching the dts files, I found 2 occurrences of IRQ0.
Prima2 has timer on IRQ0, and VersatileAB has watchdog on IRQ0. Prima2
should be fine currently as it doesn't use the of_irq_* functions to get
the timer irq, but that is an issue as it skips any translation.
VersatileAB should be okay with the VIC irqdomain support.

Changing it would also affect microblaze and openrisc which have NO_IRQ
set to -1. From what I can tell, they would both be fine at least in
terms of not using IRQ0.

Also, there's roughly 50 irq_chips that need irq_domain support under
arch/arm. So that's not a simple solution either.
