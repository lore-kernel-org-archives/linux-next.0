If they were a minority we wouldn't be hitting them on a weekly basis,
and other busses already do similar things for similar reasons. You may
not like it, but it's much less distasteful than littering random i2c
ifdefs around every driver that chooses to have an optional i2c
interface. If every multi-bus driver was forced to go through these sorts
of hoops, the drivers would be even less readable than they already are
today.
