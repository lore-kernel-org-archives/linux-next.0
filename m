Well, not so sure...

Hi all,

I am on the subject till this morning to figure out if the parameters
are SoC dependent. It seems that the ADC is the same between those two
platforms but the technology is different: I have to figure out the
details internally.

I will give you a patch on top of arm-soc soon. It will replace the one
in staging-next: does it sound good to you?

Bye,
