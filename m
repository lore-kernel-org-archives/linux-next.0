No, the problem was that the backlight was simultaneously being altered 
by two pieces of code. kpowersave is doing the backlight control via hal 
(I assume), and hal should simply not provide the Dell backlight control 
on systems that have ACPI video backlight control. There's no need to 
have this policy in the kernel.

It's a userspace problem and a straightforward userspace solution.
