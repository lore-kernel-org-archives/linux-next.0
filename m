I'm working on a better patch to fix that (and to whitelist powerpc's
relocation checks to it does not get blamed for such breakage)
Although no guarantees about that yet.

However some of the enablement and subsequent patches I would like to
merge are quite architecture specific, and I would prefer them to go
via arch trees.

So I would like to see a kbuild branch with these 3 in it, if arch
maintainers (or specifically powerpc) would be willing to pull it in
their -next branches.

Thanks,
Nick
