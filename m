Thanks for the fix (I will reorder nodes in a future patch). My opinion 
is that all STM32 DT patches should come through my STM32 tree. It is my 
role to fix this kind of conflicts. I thought it was a common rule 
(driver patches go to sub-system maintainer tree and DT to the Machine 
maintainer). For incoming next-series which contain DT+driver patches I 
will indicate clearly that I take DT patch. I'm right ?

Alex
