Thanks for that hint.

Yes.

OK, I didn't mean to get into a blame game on this.
You mentioned stubs earlier and that's what is not working AFAICT.

Below is a patch that makes the 2 reported drivers build when
CONFIG_GPIOLIB is disabled and CONFIG_GENERIC_GPIO is disabled.
What do you think of the patch?

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>

Make GPIOF_ defined values available even when GPIOLIB nor GENERIC_GPIO
is enabled by moving them to <linux/gpio.h>.
