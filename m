 Because it checks the wrong property.

 It is the reverse -- checking the DSDT ID is coarser, matching all the
systems that use the broken firmware.  With DMI we may face both false
positives and false negatives which imply further maintenance actions.  
Please note as proved over the years understanding of these issues seems
to be problematic for people, so the result may be another round of
discussions reinventing the wheel in a couple of years' time or so.

 That's my opinion only though -- if it was to hinder the progress, then I
am not going to persist.

 Have you tried to report the issue through the usual manufacturer's
support channels, BTW?  They may not even be aware of the existence of the
bug.  Of course they may dismiss it anyway, but at least they will have a
record of it somewhere.
