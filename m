This is due to the existing

    extern int _etext, _edata, _end;

in and the newly added

    extern char _end[];

to arch/m68k/kernel/setup.c.

As these are already declared in asm-generic/sections.h (which is used by
asm-m68k/sections.h), I'll switch arch/m68k/kernel/setup.c to using them.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
