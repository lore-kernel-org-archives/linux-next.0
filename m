Thanks for the hint.

I believe the following amendment would fit best:

diff --git a/drivers/leds/Kconfig b/drivers/leds/Kconfig
index e2f19f3cc6ca..ab0ac84e4c62 100644

           This supports the LED device LM3697.

But for now I'm dropping the patch set anyway until we agree on how
it should be merged across subsystems.
