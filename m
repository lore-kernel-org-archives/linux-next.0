I don't understand this.  In drivers/pci/Kconfig, we have:

  config PCI_IOV
    depends on PCI

and in drivers/crypto/qat/Kconfig, dd0f368398ea adds:

  config CRYPTO_DEV_QAT_DH895xCCVF
    select PCI_IOV

And apparently it's possible to end up with a .config with
CONFIG_PCI_IOV=3Dy but CONFIG_PCI is not set?  That seems wrong, since
we declared that PCI_IOV depends on PCI.  Does select ignore that
dependency somehow?
