recently added to the firmware?  I don't have very new dumps, particularly,
none taken without OSI(Linux) -- might do something to the SSDTs -- so I
might not have the full view of this.

Anyway, if it is that new AND we need it to work well, it means we need to
warn the user to upgrade the firmware when it is missing (and of course, add
your code to use it when it is not missing :p).

BRTO, BRTF: these are around for a while already.  But I can't find anything
that calls BRTO.  What is NetBSD doing with BRTO?

Can you send me your acpidump (and censored dmidecode) output so that I can
look at a new enough dump with PWMS support?

I'd like to have newer versions of the tables, before giving an opinion. Can
you send me the dump for your thinkpad?

I didn't look much at the code for removing duplicate ACPI video yet, but I
am fine with the basic idea.

However, if we are going to be disabling the entire firmware brightness
change system (which will include ACPI BCM, probably... need the tables to
know), that's something the X server needs to be able to enable/disable.
Otherwise, we break all such changes outside of a X display, which is not
acceptable.
