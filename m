This commit appears to cause kernel error spew while performing CPU
hotplug operations on Tegra114. For example, see the log at the end of
this message.

I guess this boot-time message is the clue:

[    0.000000] arch_timer: No interrupt available, giving up

which corresponds to this diff in /proc/interrupts:

> - 27:       2929       2216       2027       1922       GIC  27  arch_timer

The relevant DT node is probably:

I guess this is a similar problem to that which Olof reported; there's
no reg property in that node, yet #size-cells=<0> since the timer node
is a direct child of the root node.
