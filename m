Part of commit (which patches sound/soc/omap/mcbsp.c file):
8fef626 ARM/ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Remove CLKR/FSR mux configuration code

since the tree where it has been applied did not had the earlier patch:
d0db84e ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Fix 6pin mux configuration
which changed code around omap_mcbsp_6pin_src_mux().

Because of the missing part from 8fef626 the sound/soc/omap/mcbsp.c does
not compile in linux-next.

Hi Mark,

This patch has been generated against linux-next as of today.
The reason for this is that that is the only place where we have the upstream
patch (in 3.6-rc3):
d0db84e ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Fix 6pin mux configuration

and the 
8fef626 ARM/ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Remove CLKR/FSR mux configuration code

commit in the same branch.

When you applied 8fef626 you mentioned that it did not applied cleanly.
The reason was that the branch did not had commit d0db84e applied prior to the
series:
http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2012-August/054668.html

Now I can not find the d0db84e commit in the asoc tree (not in for-3.6, for-3.7
and not in for-next branch) anymore.

I don't really know what has happened, but as of now this patch is needed to fix
the OMAP audio in linux-next.

I have also prepared a branch with the OMAP patches [1]: topic/omap rebased on
top of today's mainline and fixed up the 8fef626 to it's original content.
But I think it is already late to revert the OMAP McBSP patches from for-next
and from for-3.7 branches...

CC-ing linux-next as well.

Regards,
Peter
