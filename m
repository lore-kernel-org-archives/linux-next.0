This has just shown up in next-20130617, and breaks at least the
TPS65910 and TPS62360 drivers, since they assume that the id parameter
passed to probe is non-NULL. However, now the parameter is NULL since
these drivers have both an ID table and an OF match table.

I'd like to suggest this patch be reverted an re-introduced immediately
after the merge window. That should give enough time for everyone to get
a heads-up on fixing any drivers with a similar problem, rather than
trying to cram all that in immediately before the merge window. I'd also
suggest that this patch should be accompanied by fixes for any similarly
broken drivers, based on code inspection.

Do people agree? If not, please let us know ASAP so we can post patches
to fix this.
