For the platforms I care about, it probably won't break.  For those which
do break, it's a matter of fixing their include/mach/irqs.h and the code
in their irqchips to convert the IRQ number to the correct bitmask for
the register.

However, I have suggested in the past that new platforms _should_ avoid
not just IRQ0 but IRQ0-15 (for a completely different reason to that of
'IRQ0 means no IRQ'.)  But such comments just get ignored, so I just
don't see the point in doing anything about this.  If people experience
breakage, so be it.  I too will have little sympathy but not for the same
reason.
