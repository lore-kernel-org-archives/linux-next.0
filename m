Thank you.

Who defines useful?

We have a plethora of kernel configs, so yes,
I'd be glad to see your efforts in that area.


Here's my take on kernel builds:

Ideally (randconfig) build testing wouldn't be needed
and developers would:

- know what kernel facilities their code uses and #include
  header files for all of them

- know what kernel configs their code uses and make their code
  depend on or select the needed config symbols

- actually read & review build output to look for errors and
  warnings in their code and not ignore them but actually fix them

- use sparse to check for other warnings

The current attitude of "if it builds, then it must be OK"
is not good.
