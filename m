Of course one still wants to send the final PR somewhen around -rc5/-rc6, b=
ut
there's no exact point of time where the corresponding tree management has =
to be
done in order for the correct thing to happen for linux-next.

I don't agree that the the update of -next-fixes is fragile. It has to be f=
ast
forwarded to -next anyway with the cutoff, as otherwise people can't apply =
fixes
for what's staged for the merge window anymore.

If we'd cut off but not update -next-fixes accordingly, it's an invitation =
for
committers to keep pushing to -next kicking of the cherry-picks.

I also think this works very well for drm-misc (and drm-rust).

Because it means less exposure to linux-next overall and less exposure wher=
e it
actually matters, at the end of the cycle.

It also means that if something breaks in linux-next during this period the=
 only
way to fix it is to 1. send another -next PR, 2. wait until the tree closes=
 and
push the fix to -next-fixes, 3. close the tree immediately and push the fix=
 to
-next-fixes.

Sure, I'm happy to look into this.
