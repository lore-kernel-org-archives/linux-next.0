It turns out there were a few places where we were #include'ing Linux
headers in the gcc build (asm/unistd.h, arch/icache.h, arch/spr_def.h).
I patched gcc to provide inline copies of what was needed (pretty simple
stuff and won't ever change) and asked our lead compiler guy to upstream
it back up to gcc, so using buildall.git should get easier for tilepro/tilegx.
