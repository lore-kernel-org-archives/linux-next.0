Right, the fix will be equivalent to
576b0704c9def6d54b3ae9e13b0b7567c713f568 "x86: perf: uncore: Use
hrtimer_start()"

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=142904610220085

Will post it in a second, but not sure who should take it? The arm-soc
guys, as an additional ccn patch, or Thomas as part of his series?

Thanks for pointing this out!
