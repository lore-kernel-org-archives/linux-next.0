The timelime was several years ago. Several years of complete inaction
later the chickens have come home to roost.

I refer you to Linus mail of 26 Sept 2006 to linux-kernel ('restore
libata build on frv')

Quoting Linus email:

So there we are.. ARM spent years ignoring clear direction. If ARM breaks
for a release now so be it. You've had *YEARS* to get off your collective
backsides and sort it out.

All drivers should assume that  if (!dev->irq) works. Zero is not an IRQ
except in certain buried internal invisible cases in arch code (legacy PC
timer being the obvious one).

Come to think about it we had a prior discussion about NO_IRQ in 2005
even!

The core kernel generic IRQ code knows about zero being special, many
common driver layer components such as serial and network phylib do, so
if anything it's going to fix bugs sorting the mess out on ARM.

Jut fix it. Other platforms have done so without problem.
