Thank you for testing it but please do not send anything before we
decide what to do with my pci_fixup_irqs() removal series.

No worries, yes we need to understand how to sync the changes, as I
said it is probably better for my series to be dropped, posted at
v4.13-rc1, create a branch out of it and ask all PCI host bridges
to be based against it, it is up to Bjorn to decide what's the least
complicated way for him to sync all these changes.
