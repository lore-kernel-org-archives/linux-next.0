I can only speak from a personal perspective on that one. I do _try_ no=
t=20
to put anything in there (platform data or Device Tree), which does not=
=20
belong. I have no idea how successful that notion was however.

I'm sure sure this is relevant in the current case though, as the i2c=20
properties proposed here are platform specific. What we're discussing i=
s=20
some consolidation of property names, which I do support in theory. Wha=
t=20
I fear is that this driver will lack Device Tree functionality for yet=20
another kernel version if it isn't resolved quickly.

Wolfram, are you theorising about these the multiple use of these=20
properties, or do you have some examples? I think we would do well to=20
work on these, or else they're just going to lie dormant and not get do=
ne.
