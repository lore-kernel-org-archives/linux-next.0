Oops...

After linux-next commit 2bbc89a8e9c652ee71c6c3b2e0679b7ecedb1a09
("m68k: Use Kbuild logic to import asm-generic headers"), which does:
  - remove arch/m68k/include/asm/kvm_para.h, which just included the
    asm-generic version,
  - add "generic-y +=3D kvm_para.h" to arch/m68k/include/asm/Kbuild,
it fails again:

$ make ARCH=3Dm68k headers_check
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  INSTALL include/asm-generic (35 files)
  INSTALL include/linux (372 files)
  CHECK   include/asm-generic (35 files)
  CHECK   include/linux (372 files)
usr/include/linux/kexec.h:49: userspace cannot reference function or
variable defined in the kernel
usr/include/linux/kvm_para.h:26: included file 'asm-m68k/kvm_para.h'
is not exported
usr/include/linux/soundcard.h:1054: userspace cannot reference
function or variable defined in the kernel
make[2]: *** [usr/include/linux/.check] Error 123
make[1]: *** [linux] Error 2
make: *** [headers_check] Error 2
$

After reverting Avi's fix (commit
7beb8e723c8d7da7decbbe217b79525aef73fccb. ("KVM:
Export asm-generic/kvm_para.h")) it works again. Note that it now _remo=
ves_
kvm_para.h:

$ make ARCH=3Dm68k headers_check
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  REMOVE  kvm_para.h
  INSTALL include/asm-generic (34 files)
  REMOVE  kvm_para.h
  INSTALL include/linux (371 files)
  CHECK   include/asm-generic (34 files)
  CHECK   include/linux (371 files)
usr/include/linux/kexec.h:49: userspace cannot reference function or
variable defined in the kernel
usr/include/linux/soundcard.h:1054: userspace cannot reference
function or variable defined in the kernel
$

What's the proper way to get this working in both cases??
  1. arch has it's own asm/kvm_para.h (cfr. m68k and all other arches
in mainline)
  2. arch includes asm-generic/kvm_para.h via Kbuild logic (cfr.
(only) m68k in -next)
Or is this not possible, and should I create arch/m68k/include/asm/kvm_=
para.h
again, like all other arches seem to do?
