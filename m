Right now, it issues a warning in such case. I think changing it to a
fatal error would be too premature, not long ago there were a couple of
annoying false positives.

But from the rest of the thread, I conclude that you actually meant "not
possible to select something if that something's dependencies CANNOT be
met", i.e. automatically select dependencies if that is possible. That
was actually one of the goals of Vegard Nossum's GSoC poject last year,
but I haven't heard of any outcome yet. Vegard, is there something we
could use, be it code or mistakes we could learn from?

Thanks,
Michal
