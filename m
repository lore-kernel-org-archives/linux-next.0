Yep, after this patch we have a few __atomic_ and a few __atomic32_,
which is rather unbecoming. Lemme go convert them all to __atomic32_.

I've no idea; I use this thing:

  git://git.infradead.org/users/segher/buildall.git

Although I've got some local modifications, none are to the actual
toolchain building part (although I suppose I should send segher a
patch).

I have binutils-gdb.git and gcc.bit checkouts and point the buildall
config to that (both are on latest stable branches binutils-2_26-branch
and gcc-6-branch resp.). And I point the kernel path to my current
hacked up tree.

I don't really rebuild the entire toolchains often, mostly only when I
really need a new GCC or its getting really old (like I used 5.3.0 for a
long while).
