What architecture is this on (you should always include information like
this anyway so people can try to reproduce what you're seeing)?  In any
case, please talk to the architecture maintainers about this - it's an
issue in the architecture GPIO support (or lack thereof) rather than a
driver problem.

Also adding Dmitry who submitted the driver - Randy, please try to
remember to CC relevant people.
