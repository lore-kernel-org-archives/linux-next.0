Dunno.  When I ran aranym it popped up a menu screen and asked me to co=
nfigure=20
it, so I tracked down a couple of howtos I haven't had time to read yet=
=20
(http://wiki.aranym.org/aranym_from_scratch and=20
http://wiki.aranym.org/afs/setup_linux).

At a glance the emulator doesn't seem to actually support a serial port=
, so no=20
serial console, which is a bit of a limiting factor for how I normally =
use=20
it...
