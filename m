The Device Tree should supply any platform configuration which the=20
driver needs in order to correctly setup for a particular machine. This=

is exactly what the platform_data structure did before, hence is is=20
reasonable to assume that whatever information resides in that structur=

would be required in the Device Tree.

Then what do you do with the platform data?
