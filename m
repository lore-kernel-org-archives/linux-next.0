Because it shouldn't matter from which tree they come from to get the
tests run. *That* is the problem: effectively we have independent
projects in the kernel. If you tell me that my change did not run the
ext4 tests (even if I Cc'd you or maybe some ML, etc.), it means there
is something wrong.

Yes, I have also experienced one-liners breaking entire projects.
Ideally, any change should be assumed to break everything unless
proved otherwise, and I agree with having as much testing as possible
-- see above for the actual problem here.

I believe you -- but actually I would *expect* that. Nobody runs them
because nobody has either the time, the expertise, or feels the need
to do so. It is not a matter of "being easy to run". It is simply that
people won't do it unless you force them to (and if you force them,
you will lose some contributions).

The solution is not providing slides, documentation, or making it
fool-proof. The solution, in my view, is avoiding people having to do
the tests. Currently, I thought we do that in the kernel by Cc'ing
whoever is a maintainer of the code and letting that person do
whatever is required for those changes. Of course, you can automate
this in many fancy ways as many projects/companies have done (and as
you describe for Google).

However...

...I don't agree. I don't think this follows from the above
discussion. While release management and testing are topics that go
together (pretty much always), they are two different, independent
problems. I am talking here about the need for some "software" to do
the release management (i.e. merging many trees, doing integration,
etc.), not the testing side of it (which can change irrespective of
the release management side; e.g. may have different triggers, may
have different requirements, may use different systems to help, etc.).

Actually, it is fairly easy to prove: Pick Documentation/ and imagine
it was only plain text files without processing required (as in the
old days). For that "project", you don't need any testing whatsoever,
but you still need to do release integration. For ext4, you may want
to use your testing scripts. For drivers/foo/bar.c, maybe the only way
of testing is plugging the hardware and seeing that it works. So,
different projects, different testing mechanisms; but same release
integration at the end of the day.

Of course it has been "solved". All projects with hundreds of
contributors/subprojects/... have to deal with the same issues, and
they have to keep moving forward at the end of the day. The point is
not how Google, or CERN, or anybody else does it. The point is that
there should be a better way to handle this which makes kernel
development better.

I explained the issue we faced at CERN years ago simply because it was
very similar to this (merging given tags of different trees,
basically). I am not sure how/if your Google example is relevant here,
since it is a completely custom system, it is very different to what
the kernel does, etc. I understand you are trying to say "this is no
news, there are other ways of solving it, it is solved at Google"; but
with my "example" I was not trying to say "we solved it at CERN" or
trying to say I am a "guru"; I was simply stating that it seems there
could be a project coming out of this to solve this space *in the
context of the kernel workflow*.

This paragraph seems to follow from the fact that you connect
heavily-automated testing with release integration. I don't
necessarily agree with that as explained above, so I think I could cut
here this part of the discussion, but anyway, here it goes: coding
development practices are not completely tied to release integration.
Same as testing: i.e. you *can* do release integration (and heavy
testing) without strict coding development guidelines. We actually do
that at the kernel nowadays (and we did it at CERN too).

Not sure how the kernel is preventing semantic conflicts (in different
ways than other projects, I mean). What do you mean?

I would say many commits are local enough that it is not really a
problem. The issue is non-local commits, and I am not that confident
it works for 99.99% of those.

Sure, but regardless of how well it works, the fact is that Stephen is
managing some custom (and AFAIK, ad hoc) scripts. That usually means
there is something that may be factorized out.

Agreed, but changes are not necessarily bad, i.e. they are not
guaranteed to be worse than the previous state. Actually, I would
argue we could reach a better state of the art for *all*
commits/cases, not only corner ones.

Cheers,
Miguel
