I agree, but in this instance it really does stand to reason.

1. No unified bindings currently exist.
2. I don't have time to create them.
3. It will probably take quite a bit of time for someone else to get ro=
und to creating them.
4. The bindings I'm proposing are siloed by vendor and driver, so will =
cause no harm.
5. I've already volunteered to move them over to the unified ones once =
created.
6. These allow support for the driver to work with DT, at the moment it=
 does not.

Personally, I think there is more to be gained by applying the (working=
) vendor specific bindings to the vendor specific driver until some mor=
e consolidated ones appear.
