The `rolw' variant is already protected by `#if defined
(__mcfisaaplus__) || defined (__mcfisac__)',
so I think you can replace the `#elif defined(CONFIG_MMU)' by a plain `=
#else'.
Or are there cases where you don't want to have __arch_swab32 at all?

Copying the signal experts on linux-m68k...

Yes.
