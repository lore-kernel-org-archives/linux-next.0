I still see two conflicting trees in linux-next as of today, neither of
them is your keystone tree:

arm-soc/next/drivers:
ae3874cc931b ARM: keystone: Drop PM domain support for k2g
52835d59fc6c soc: ti: Add ti_sci_pm_domains driver
7cc119f29b19 dt-bindings: Add TI SCI PM Domains
213ec7fed302 PM / Domains: Do not check if simple providers have phandle ce=
lls
a5ea7a0fcbd7 PM / Domains: Add generic data pointer to genpd data struct

pm/pm-domains:
9da73c55f95f ARM: keystone: Drop PM domain support for k2g
112572283742 soc: ti: Add ti_sci_pm_domains driver
45da8edd1741 dt-bindings: Add TI SCI PM Domains
b1013fa55589 PM / Domains: Do not check if simple providers have phandle ce=
lls

mains
41e2c8e0060d PM / Domains: Clean up code validating genpd's status
8ce95844c853 PM / Domain: remove conditional from error case

For all I can tell (and matching what Stephen found), the version in
the 'pm' tree
is the one you intended to send, while the version we merged into arm-soc
has not only a different git commit ID but also some odd comments that
are not present in the PM version:
