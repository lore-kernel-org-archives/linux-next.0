I think I see the merit of a prompt for PC104 devices. I've encountered
a use case recently which I'm curious about in this scenario. Given the
compatibility with ISA, manufacturers may occasionally develop variants
of existing ISA devices by duplicating the firmware on a PC/104 form
factor.

I'm working on an IIO DAC driver for the Measurement Computing CIO-DAC
family (CIO-DAC08, CIO-DAC16, and PC104-DAC06); while not a GPIO driver,
I believe it can serve as a decent example. Interestingly, while the
CIO-DAC08 and CIO-DAC16 are true ISA devices, the PC104-DAC06 is a
PC/104 variant compatible with the others in the family. The IIO DAC
driver works just as well with the PC104-DAC06, as it does with the true
ISA devices in the family.

What would the Kconfig depends line look in this scenario? I imagine
simply "depends on PC104" would be inappropriate since there are a
number of true ISA devices supported by the driver, but "depends on
ISA_BUS_API || PC104" seems somewhat redundant when the PC104 Kconfig
option implies ISA_BUS_API. This situation isn't that much of an issue
overall, but I anticipate encountering it occassionally as I develop
future PC/104 drivers.
