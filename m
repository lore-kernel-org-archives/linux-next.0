Why do you want to continue building autofs4.ko? (or allowing to)
What's actually wrong with a stright rename?
If the new module can be auto-loaded by both name (by providing an
alias), there's no need to keep ability to build autofs4.ko, I think.

Well, maybe except of the case when autofs is needed in initramfs (like
for systemd).  For this, indeed, you can keep autofs4.ko which is a
dummy depending on autofs.ko...

By doing it this way, you're losing all git history.
If you perform stright rename and git detects it, you
can use, eg, git log --follow to see whole hostory
across rename.  This way you create new files without
history.

So I strongly shuggest actually renaming the subdirectory
(together with appropriate kconfig/makefile changes so
things are bisectable), and creating the stubs after this.

Thanks,
