I merged it I think, Alex made a long series enabling compile
testing and I started to cherry-pick the first commits to let
them trickle in.

I was worried about it because some of the patches caused
severe build problems on some archs.

It's a  bit tricky to know what to do here: we want compile
coverage to get proper testing, when we turn it on we get regressions,
so trying to improve things make things break and it becomes a
vicious circle of trouble. I don't know what the biggest pain is ...

I don't really see the conclusion of this discussion thread, whether
I should revert the patch or not? For fixes or next?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
