Just stop using NO_IRQ. First in drivers/of/irq.c, then in any drivers
as you notice breakage.

Don't *change* NO_IRQ to zero (that whole #define is broken - leave it
around as a marker of brokenness), just start removing it from all the
ARM drivers that use the OF infrastructure. Which is presumably not
all that many yet.

So whenever you find breakage, the fix now is to just remove NO_IRQ
tests, and replace them with "!irq".
