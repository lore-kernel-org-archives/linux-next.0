No, SYMBOL_PREFIX is now defined as a non-string, same as asm files, but
the now unused definition in linux/kernel.h did define it as a string as
it used CONFIG_SYMBOL_PREFIX which is a string. When I said "and is
defined as a string" I was referring to the one in linux/kernel.h that
this removes.

Does that make sense? It's all a bit messy unfortunately (hence RFC).

Cheers
James
