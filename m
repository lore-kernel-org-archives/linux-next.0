Thanks for the report.  The regulator code is rather foreign
to me, but I think I figured out the expectations on the names
last night when looking at a similar patch here:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg163418.html

I'll fix these two patches up, but next time I'll just report
the regulator regressions and let the sub-system maintainer
or the platform maintainer sort them out.

Paul.
