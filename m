Yep. Looks clearly broken. blob_len is also declared twice in that
function which is just plain wrong. What probably makes the most sense
is to make it a u16 and get rid of the second declaration lower in the
function. But, there's another semi-related problem here too...

blob_len gets assigned the return value of build_ntlmssp_auth_blob.
That function however doesn't have any mechanism to pass back an
error, even though it calls setup_ntlmv2_rsp and that function can
return one.

The whole house of cards needs a bit of rework I think...

Shirish, since you're already doing work in this area, can you fix that
too?

Thanks,
