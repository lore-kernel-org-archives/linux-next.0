drivers/acpi/processor_core.c:852:              ACPI_EXCEPTION((AE_INFO, status,
drivers/acpi/processor_core.c-853-                              "Processor Device is not present"));

and

drivers/acpi/parser/psloop.c-895-                                       if (status == AE_AML_NO_RETURN_VALUE) {
drivers/acpi/parser/psloop.c:896:                                               ACPI_EXCEPTION((AE_INFO, status,

do very much look like BIOS bugs.

You want to split BIOS bug and kernel bug ACPI messages?
This is a good idea.
But this should be started in ACPICA code first.
ACPI_EXCEPTION is an ACPICA interface having an
ACPI_FIRMWARE_BUG for relevant messages would be nice.
There are probably also a lot ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO,
info messages suppressing bugs.
Being able to mark them with a ACPI_FIRMWARE_BUG interface, 
would be great.

As suggested some days ago, I'd like to have an interface in the kernel
to report firmware bugs via printk, netlink, both (or compiled out) to
userspace.
As soon as ACPICA can differ and invoke e.g.
ACPI_FIRMWARE_BUG, it can easily be extended to use a kernel
interface to send firmware bugs to userspace as such.

If you are already working in this area or have suggestions, please let me
know or keep me in CC.
Otherwise I will try to come up with some patches sooner or later.

Thanks,

         Thomas

BTW: I saw a lot people used:
ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_ERROR,
again in linux (not ACPICA code!) which is wrong.

These are suppressed if ACPI_DEBUG is not compiled in.
It does not make sense to use a debug interface for errors.
IMO ACPI_DB_ERROR and ACPI_DB_WARN
should be reverted or somehow enforced that
it cannot be used in kernel code anymore, maybe they should be renamed
into DB_DEBUG and DB_WHATEVER?

Here these are again used, some look like sever errors (on a first glance),
some not:
