Looks OK for me on a first scan, though probably the best approach is to
go through and just enable gpiolib on all the architectures that don't
have it already yet - that's the more generally useful approach as it
means that if plugin boards for the platform need to use gpiolib they
can.  I already did this for Alpha, I guess I'll try to look see what
other architectures could use it.
