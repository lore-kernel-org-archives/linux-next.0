Thanks Stephen.  By "related changes" I just meant that if I were to
make a branch to carry the fixup, I'd need to all merge in the at91
related changes that are on linux-next but not on an rc tag yet.  But
please ignore this statement if it doesn't make sense.  I'm not yet
knowledgeable on the workflow once submitted patchsets reach this
level.
