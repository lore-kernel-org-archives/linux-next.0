Ideally I'd be able to run allmodconfig for each merge, but I have
neither the computing power nor the time to do that. I can add
allmodconfig to the set of configurations that I build after the final
merge, but I don't know how much good that is if I don't actually have
any time to fix them up.

Furthermore I'm beginning to think that perhaps we should create some
infrastructure around this that would make it easier to submit requests
for build coverage. Quite a few people seem to run autobuilders, so if
all those could be harnessed to build linux-next (perhaps even on a per
merge basis) that would give great coverage.

It's quite possible that I messed that up during the merge. The bcache
conflicts weren't very trivial. This one in particular seems to be
caused by a commit that went into 3.12-rc5 and one in the block tree's
linux-next branch.
