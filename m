(adding Linus Walleij and Alexander Stein to Cc)

Unfortunately, the changelog also doesn't say what triggered that
change. I guess there was a driver that did 'select OF_GPIO'
and had a dependency on COMPILE_TEST, though I don't see any
driver doing that in linux-next.

I think the commit should just be reverted, it clearly breaks
stuff, and whatever needs it can be fixed in a better way.

Specifically, we have three ways that the OF_GPIO symbol 
is used:

a) it is implicitly enabled when both GPIOLIB and OF are turned on
b) some drivers 'depends on OF_GPIO'
c) some other drivers 'select OF_GPIO'

The combination of b) and c) can easily lead to circular dependencies,
and is also confusing. It would be better to change all of those
to 'depends on'.
