 I meant "... two models [of HP laptops] using this southbridge..." of 
course. :)

 Now I did a search of the Internet and have become puzzled.  Apparently
there *are* other devices using this DSDT.  See for example a thread at:  
"http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=359559" where an owner of an
HP Compaq 6715s has some other problems with a DSDT which coincidentally
is the very same HP/SB400/10000 (though built with a different ASL
compiler, hmm...).

 Matthew, where did you get these DMI IDs from? -- I cannot see them being 
reported in any bootstrap log.
