I dont know if it's the same thing, but I remember at one time that when
pressing my brightness keys (on a T61, intel graphics), the acpi event
appeared in /proc/acpi/event like 1 second later. I didn't check
precisely, but it could really be those 750ms. Irrc, this was only
happening after first suspend to ram.

Do these patches mean that, maybe in 2.6.27, brightness keys would work
directly from kernel, without needing hal, gnome-power-manager or
anything else, like X?

I can try those patches and report back, but on which kernel should I
apply them? 2.6.26-rc8? Or some git?

Cheers,
