This can be renamed - it is only used for control and data port address init 
(aside from serial console, which should probably be separated out if it cannot 
be reconciled).

Time to merge with pmac_zilog or ip22zilog (the latter even needing similar 
register access delays as Ataris). 

What is the time frame to gs being removed? I admit to 'owning' atari_scc which 
was based on vme_scc so I'll have to deal with that sooner or later.
