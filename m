Why not make it so that if COMPILE_TEST is enabled, the build warns if 
it can't find the headers, otherwise it fails?  That way, people who are 
doing all*config builds but don't have the headers will still get some 
build coverage, and the people who are enabling it as a security feature 
will still get build failures.
