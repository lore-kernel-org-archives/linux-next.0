EM_OR32 is used to define ELF_ARCH, which per its comment is used in core
dumps. No idea if that is important/relevant. You tell me ;-).

The kernel builds with both the old (or32) and new (or1k) toolchain after
removing EM_OR32 and defining ELF_ARCH as EM_OPENRISC. I can not test the
kernel built with the or32 toolchain, but qemu is happy with the image built
using the or1k toolchain.

I'll be happy to submit a patch to remove EM_OR32 if it is not needed anymore.

Thanks,
Guenter
