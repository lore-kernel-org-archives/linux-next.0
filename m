Dmitry - irrelevant. If we know of breakage, then that is a FACT, and it's 
a regression, and it needs to be fixed.

Trying to say "there might be _other_ breakage that we don't even know of" 
does not change the situation ONE LITTLE BIT!

Don't you see how stupid that approach is? You're basically trying to make 
excuses for known breakage by saying that there might be _other_ breakage 
that we don't know about? Why the _hell_ do you think that is an excuse at 
all?

You're missing the point.

People are supposed to be able to upgrade things _independently_. It's not 
about "you're supposed to be able to upgrade the kernel, but not upgrade 
user space". It's about "you shouldn't evemn have to _worry_ about it.

Sorry, but you're simply wrong.

If somebody has the commit that broke user space, that commit will be 
_reverted_ unless it's fixed. It's that simple. The rules are: we don't 
knowingly break user space.
