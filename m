I dived into this, and spent a little more time on it than is healthy f=
or me :-(

"make headers_check" is also broken on m32r since Avi's fix, as m32r
doesn't even
have <asm/kvm_param.h>:

| usr/include/linux/kvm_para.h:26: included file 'asm-m32r/kvm_para.h'
is not exported

commit 3b5d56b9317fa7b5407dff1aa7b115bf6cdbd494 ("kvmclock: Add functio=
ns to
check if the host has stopped the vm") created <asm/kvm_para.h> for
all architectures,
but forgot cris and m32r.

BTW, do we really want all these <asm/kvm_para.h> pointing to (empty)
<asm-generic/kvm_para.h> after exporting?

commit 7dcf2a9fced59e58e4694cdcf15850c01fdba89b ("remove dummy asm/kvm.=
h files")
removed the similar dummy <asm/kvm.h> files, and added a rule to
include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm instead:

ifneq ($(wildcard $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/asm/kvm.h \
                  $(srctree)/include/asm-$(SRCARCH)/kvm.h),)
header-y  +=3D kvm.h
endif

There's a similar rule for kvm_para.h:

ifneq ($(wildcard $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/asm/kvm_para.h \
                  $(srctree)/include/asm-$(SRCARCH)/kvm_para.h),)
header-y  +=3D kvm_para.h
endif

It's this rule that's now biting m68k, as it no longer works when using
arch/*/include/asm/Kbuild to import <asm-generic/kvm_para.h>.
(I guess it'll bite SH soon, too).

I found two ways to fix it:
  1. Remove the "ifneq" above from include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm,
     so kvm_para.h is exported unconditionally.
     Note that this breaks m32r and cris, as they don't have
asm/kvm_para.h yet),
   2. Add a similar "ifneq" to include/asm-generic/Kbuild, to make
     the export of <linux/kvm_para.h> conditional.
     I guess we want to remove all "dummy" kvm_para.h again, too?
