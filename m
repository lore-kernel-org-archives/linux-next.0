This adds a hopefully helpful comment above the (seemingly weird)
compiler flag selection logic.

 # Handle stack protector mode.
+#
+# Since kbuild can potentially perform two passes (first with the old
+# .config values and then with updated .config values), we cannot error out
+# if a desired compiler option is unsupported. If we were to error, kbuild
+# could never get to the second pass and actually notice that we changed
+# the option to something that was supported.
+#
+# Additionally, we don't want to fallback and/or silently change which compiler
+# flags will be used, since that leads to producing kernels with different
+# security feature characteristics depending on the compiler used. ("But I
+# selected CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG! Why did it build with _REGULAR?!")
+#
+# The middle ground is to warn here so that the failed option is obvious, but
+# to let the build fail with bad compiler flags so that we can't produce a
+# kernel when there is a CONFIG and compiler mismatch.
