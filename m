Unfortunately, with the c1e.patch on top of the apic.patch on top of the
current mainline I get the same symptoms as with -next:
- processes freeze
- CPU loads are unreasonably high
- things generally get stucked if I don't move the mouse or press keys

Removing the the c1e.patch makes things work again.
