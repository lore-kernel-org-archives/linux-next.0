Yes Chris, my fault here, it is true that I should have send those
patches to you and linux-mmc.

Indeed, and in the meantime, it seems that these Kconfig modifications
are not as harmless as the others in the series.

I propose to redo a pull request without those two patches. We will
resend them directly through the MMC subsystem together with other
mmc-related fixes. Moreover, all this will probably make more sense as
3.5 modifications...
