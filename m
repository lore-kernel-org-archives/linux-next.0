For most consumer level hardware the vendors generally don't
really care if Linux runs on it or not.

Also they very rarely fix anything after release anyways because
they don't make enough money on it.

For server hardware that is different (vendors care about Linux,
but typically not about mainline, but about given RHEL/SLES  releases),
but even there we generally try to work around BIOS bugs
(at least as long as it is possible)
because it tends to be quite difficult logistically to require
a BIOS update. In the end it just hurts the user.

It is.

That is exactly what happens.
