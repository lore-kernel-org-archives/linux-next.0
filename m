The VM is running Fedora 27 with a kernel built off of latest
linux-next as of March 1st.

Thanks. The behavior of it has me wondering if we are looking at
something like an uninitialized data issue or something like that
since as I mentioned I don't see this occur on every boot, just on
most of them. So every now and then I can boot up the VM without any
issues, but most of the time it will boot and then get stuck waiting
on jobs that take forever.
