I must admit I didn't go count them.

No, those are synthetic interrupt sources. If you look at the interrupt
code, there is a fake interrupt controller registered on IRQ 4 that
looks at the SCC status bits and triggers the correct interrupt. Take
a look at mac_scc_dispatch in arch/m68k/mac/macints.c for details. The
pmac_zilog code does it a little different by tying the two devices
together and only registering for one interrupt and passing them off.

That is definitely true on any Mac. Apple was generally stingy with
interrupt sources. For example, some mac systems don't even have a
real IRQ per NuBus slot even though they do all at least have a way
to detect which slot asserted the interrupt.

I'm sure we could do something like that with flags.

It depends on what you mean by standard configuration. Some PowerBooks
shipped with internal modems, but I don't think there is any model
that always had one. It was an option on most later m68k PowerBooks
while most early ppc PowerBooks always had an internal modem.

The AV Macs are quite a bit different from an IRQ perspective. They
don't hook much of anything up directly, so the layout is slightly more
logical. In particular, the registration of mac_scc_dispatch to IRQ 4
is conditionalized on !psc_present to exclude the AV models. It's all
the models using VIA1 as the main interrupt controller that need it.
The SCC interrupt line is never hooked up to a VIA chip, but it is
connected to the PSC on AV macs and the SCC IOP on the IIfx.  Sorry
if the way I wrote this was confusing.

It's hard to say for sure without trying it to see how it turns out.

Seems reasonable.
