It's an issue because the xconfig frontends is qconf, which as the name
implies is using Qt, which *is* C++, and includes list.h.

So, list.h is included by both by C and C++ code.

So yes, list.h can be compiled by a C++ compiler.

Now, granted: list.h should all be enclosed in:
    ifdef __cpluplus
    extern "C" {
    endif
    ...
    ifdef __cpluplus
    }
    endif

Was that the fix you were suggesting between the lines? ;-)

Yann E. MORIN.
