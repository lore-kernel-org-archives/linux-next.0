Violent nack. Drivers which optionally use I2C are a minority.
Designing them in such a way that a single #ifdef CONFIG_I2C will make
them work can't be that hard, really. Not to mention that having a
dozen stubs in i2c.h in the CONFIG_I2C=n case won't save you much work
at the driver level anyway, because you certainly need to run different
code paths depending on how the device is connected, and you also have
to differentiate between the "I2C support is missing" case and the "I2C
device registration failed" case, etc.
