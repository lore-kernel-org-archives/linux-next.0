Try the next patch, it works for the T61.
These IGD parts could take quite a while still, while Toshibas and others
remain broken (and T61 poke on wrong hardware which could cause
all kind of badness).
The patch has an easy switch to allow video.ko to take over again
if IGD is detected and Linux is capable of it.

Please consider to take these two.

Thanks,
