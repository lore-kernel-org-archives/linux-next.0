This bug only exists in linux-next, as the code in question wasn't
merged in Linus's tree yet. It is drawn into linux-next from Ben
Dooks's next-i2c branch:
  http://git.fluff.org/gitweb?p=3Dbjdooks/linux.git;a=3Dshortlog;h=3Dre=
fs/heads/next-i2c

This is where it has to be fixed, so only Ben can do it. Ben, please?

Meanwhile, it should be possible to apply a hot fix to linux-next
directly, Stephen does it pretty often. Stephen, could you please apply
this fix temporarily until Ben wakes up and applies it to his tree?
