It fails to locate the root partition if you are using the default root
device on x86 (the one hard-wired into bzImage, it uses hard-coded 8-bit
major/minor numbers).

Now I see that the issue is easily fixed by passing the root device name
with "root=" (since it will figure out the actual major/minor numbers
later) and that the default root device is said to be deprecated according
to Documentation/x86/boot.txt (OTOH there is no warning at all that it is
deprecated and that you should be using "root=" so I'm not convinced that
I'm the only one who would hit the unfortunate combination).

Actually it seems that CONFIG_DEBUG_BLOCK_EXT_DEVT introduction (which I
think is a nice step forward) is a good oportunity to put the deprecation
of the default root device further, i.e. it may be worth to hook the
default root device check and/or CONFIG_DEBUG_BLOCK_EXT_DEVT one into
mount_block_root().

Thanks,
Bart
