I am not sure if it should be CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK or CONFIG_BLOCK. After all, the
code you're wrapping doesn't really depend on CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK, it gets consumed by it, and
it depends (in using that one define) only on CONFIG_BLOCK. Maybe I'm overthinking it
and the code should just define it's own MAX_MMC_PART_NAME to be like 10 or something.
