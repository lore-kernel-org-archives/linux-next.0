Hi OIof,

You may drop this patch if you wish so, but its not correct to say that this
was not reviewed. Following are comments from "Arnd Bergmann"
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2013-May/047030.html
And follow-up reasoning..
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2013-May/047032.html


And based on Arnd's feedbacks patches which contained changes in 
binding string was even dropped from the series, please see 
cover-letter of V3 set below.
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2013-June/047319.html
- PATCH-4 <DROPPED> update DT attribute for ti,nand-ecc-opt 
	- received feedback to keep DT mapping independent of linuxism
- PATCH-4:<NEW> : ARM: dts: AM33xx: updated default ECC scheme in nand-ecc-opt
	- independent patch for AM335x-evm.dts update based on PATCH-2

So, in case you have objections to same earlier patch where I had
introduced 'linux-based' nomenclature for bindings, that particular
one is already dropped in V3 of this patch series.


with regards, pekon
