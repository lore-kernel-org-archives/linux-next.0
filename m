It's whatever the tree is called in -next; I think the general hope is
that if you have included a tree that is -next you'll be aware of what
it is.  As a reminder the trees I currently have you (amost others) as a
contact for are:

   drm-intel-fixes:
       https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/i915/kernel.git for-linux-next-fixes

   drm-intel:
       https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/i915/kernel.git for-linux-next

That's what happens currently, these notifications are generated based
on checks done on the new non-mainline commits that appear in your tree
each day.

Are you sure this isn't something that you've picked up in one of your
inter-tree DRM merges?  There's a general pattern of DRM trees sending
unadressed issues to their upstream and being slow with sending the
fixes, then the same issue appearing in all the other DRM trees as you
the various DRM branches cross merge with each other.  For Fixes stuff
that's just going to happen unfortunately given that you don't rebase.
The common case here is that downstreams are sending things to their
upstreams, in general it is useful for the upstream maintainers to get
notified about issues.

Please don't top post, reply in line with needed context.  This allows
readers to readily follow the flow of conversation and understand what
you are talking about and also helps ensure that everything in the
discussion is being addressed.
