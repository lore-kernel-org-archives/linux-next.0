No - thought that the bluesmoke-list had moved to linux-edac.

Added myself to the driver maintainer in the i3000_edac.c file. The
patch-set adds support for i82975x in the i3000 driver, which is
better structured.
TODO:
    1. Change Kconfig file - select I3000 for i82975x support
    2. Delete i82975x_edac.c file
    3. Update MAINTAINERS file
