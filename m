When you rebase, if the commit is re-applied, the committer changes to
you, so you need to add your SoB to all commits you rebased.

I suppose you could override it with GIT_COMMITTER_NAME and
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL environment variables, but that sort of distorts
the SoB if any changes were added due to rebasing, such as resolution
of merge conflicts.
