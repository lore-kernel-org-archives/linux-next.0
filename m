This is unnecessary logic. Let's just follow the spec. There's no need 
to use thinkpad_acpi here.

No. The DRM can be (and usually is) built as a module and OSI strings 
are going to be checked at ACPI init time. This can't be made to work 
correctly. Vendors can choose whether to use the opregion or old-style 
support based on whether the driver has enabled the support.
