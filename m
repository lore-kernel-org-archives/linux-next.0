But it _does_ get confused, really.

Here you go:

[    0.108006] ..TIMER: vector=0x30 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
[    0.108006] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[    0.108006] ...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ... <3>
[    0.108006] ..... (found apic 0 pin 2) ...<3> works.
