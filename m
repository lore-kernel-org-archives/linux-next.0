Hi Linus,

these are two patches to fix build errors I've run into that are fallout
from your removal of the pinctrl/devinfo.h include from device.h. I sure
can imagine that there are more like this, but these seem to be the
common ones, judging by my own build tests and the kernel-build-reports
mailing list.

I'm sending these to you directly because I think it makes sense for you
to apply these on top of 23c35f48f5fb ("pinctrl: remove include file
from <linux/device.h>") rather than have these go in through their
respective maintainer trees, so that the build gets fixed as quickly as
possible.

Thierry
