So, remove this no-clone optimization and stage it for the next merge 
window. There's something we don't understand, so don't merge it. This 
patch is just papering over the problem.

"Stacking noclone targets creates more complexity than is tolerable" just 
means that no one knows what is hapenning there.

Meanwile, we could get access to the system that reports hangs and test it 
there.
