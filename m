Yeah, they are stored in a global array __start___param, and the curren=
t
code expects the prefixes to be sorted, so the sysfs directories can be
created for every first new prefix.

They have been module options, not prefixed kernel parameters so far,
and the prefix was just the module name.
So it just strikes back, that acpi uses generic names for the modules,
there would have been no problem if "power" would be called "acpi_power=
"
and the options would just be =EF=BB=BF"acpi.acpica_version" and
"acpi_power.nocheck".

But well, there are driver modules just called "option", so acpi is not
that bad. :)

We could try to look up existing directories to use instead of expectin=
g
that we need to create and own them. I guess, we have the same issue if
we compile the code as a module and load it later, while some other
built-in code or module has already used the same prefix.
