It doesn't match what the driver does - have you not been following the
discussion on the breakage caused by your commit b70661c70830 ?

Okay, so all the DT users _only_ use 16-bit accesses, and end up
_emulating_ 8-bit accesses through a 16-bit read-modify-write
sequence, even when they may be perfectly capable of 8-bit accesses,
because this fine detail of the SMC91x driver hasn't been understood.
