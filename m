Good.

ARM developers have been told to change this for several years. The nice
approach hasn't worked, the patient approach hasn't worked so now finally
ARM is going to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the work
everyone else did several years ago.

I have so little sympathy over this that you'll need a quantum physicist
to measure it.

You've had years to fix it. If I were you I'd delete NO_IRQ from your
tree, type make and get it done. It's not even a big job to clean it out.

At that point various other drivers will also start working properly on
ARM because they use 0 for polled mode.
