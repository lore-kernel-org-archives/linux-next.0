Should be ok now - It was missing an update that Aurelien and I worked
on for that patch - so I backed that patch out.   It was also
suggested that that Kconfig parm and #ifdef be removed since SMB3.11
is strongly recommended to be set (which would have avoided this as
well) and will be added to the default list of dialects in the future.
