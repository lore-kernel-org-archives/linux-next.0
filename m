I'd suggest that you each just take the numbers we talked about and
add them in your respective git trees, at the end of the current tables.

Stephen and Linus can then do a trivial add/add merge between the
three trees that does not involve changing any of the lines besides
keeping them in the right order. The result should then be

== arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl
422    i386    futex_time64        sys_futex            __ia32_sys_futex
423    i386    sched_rr_get_interval_time64
sys_sched_rr_get_interval    __ia32_sys_sched_rr_get_interval
424    i386    pidfd_send_signal     sys_pidfd_send_signal
__ia32_sys_pidfd_send_signal
425    i386    io_uring_setup          sys_io_uring_setup
__ia32_compat_sys_io_uring_setup
426    i386    io_uring_enter          sys_io_uring_enter
 __ia32_sys_io_uring_enter
427    i386    io_uring_register       sys_io_uring_register
__ia32_sys_io_uring_register

== arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
...
334    common  rseq                    __x64_sys_rseq
# don't use numbers 387 through 423, add new calls after the last
# 'common' entry
424    common    pidfd_send_signal      __x64_sys_pidfd_send_signal
425    common    io_uring_setup           __x64_sys_io_uring_setup

# x32-specific system call numbers start at 512 to avoid cache impact

# is defined.
#

My hope is that in the future, any new system call will get added to
all 16 syscall.tbl files at once, but let's maybe not do this for 5.1
yet, since that only causes more conflicts. I can simply follow up
with a patch to add pidfd_send_signal and io_uring_* everywhere
during the merge window.
