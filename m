I see this is a generic problem, no idea why I didn't pass these
unnamed as NULL in the first place, probably my ignorance as usual.

I fixed it up in my patch making them all anonymous and rebasing
the rest as well. Let's see how it looks after the merge window.

I will also need to rebase on top of Janusz changes and then it
will look even better.

Janusz: would be super if you could test my patches after that!

Yours,
Linus Walleij
