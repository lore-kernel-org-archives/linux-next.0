Andrew,

It is not like we broke ABI here. The progam (synaptics driver) had a
grave bug. Older kernels happened to paper over the bug because they
did not fill the whole buffer that was advertised as available. Now
that we have more data to report the bug bit us. What do you want me
to do?

Synaptics driver is a small package and takes 2 minutes to recompile.
You don't have to update entire X server with it (in fact I don't think
it is even part of X distribution because it is GPL).
