As with every other subsystem in the kernel look at the log for the
thing your changing and do something that visually resembles it.  If you
want get_maintainers to do this for you you'll need to write the code
(or convince someone else to do it).

I'm pretty sure I've mentioned this before...  actually, if you're
relying on get_maintainers that's probably some of the false positives
too.  If you've found an issue related to the -next integration that's
one thing but if you've just noticed a random thing in the kernel that
could be improved that's not really something about -next.
