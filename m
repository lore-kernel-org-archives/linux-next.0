Ok, got it. I've rewritten the commit message now to reflect this,
and have applied your patch on top of the next/drivers branch.

Thanks a lot for the fast roundtrip in fixing it. Hopefully, tomorrow's
linux-next works better now.

commit a78a3c8ef715b94de3ab27633866d4bde3e2226f
Author: Pawel Moll <pawel.moll@arm.com>

    bus: arm-ccn: Use hrtimer_start() again
    
    hrtimer_start() will no longer defer already expired timers to the
    softirq in 4.2, and the __hrtimer_start_range_ns() function is
    getting removed, causing build errors when both the tip tree and
    the arm-ccn changes are merged.
    
    This changes the code back to using hrtimer_start, which will
    do the right thing after this branch gets merged with the
    timers update from tip.
    
    As pointed out after a discussion on the mailing list, the result will
    not be worse than the what was there before you pulled my updates, as
    the code was using normal hrtimer_start(). It's just when I realised
    that it should be pinned I looked at what x86 uncore pmu is doing and
    shamelessly (and probably a bit mindlessly) copied the "do not wakeup"
    version from there.
