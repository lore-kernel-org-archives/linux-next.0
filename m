|  Thanks -- this is very important and useful information as it shows the
| exact alternative used.
| 
|  With such a configuration the "x86: I/O APIC: timer through 8259A
| second-chance" patch should not matter, because the only change it
| introduces is an attempt to try the same I/O APIC pin again, but with the
| IRQ0 line of the master 8259A enabled.  That's not a terribly unusual 
| configuration and nothing should get confused in the system.
| 
|  Barring the unlikely possibility of the 8259A actually being wired to 
| INTIN2 of the I/O APIC I can see two possible explanations:
| 
| 1. The 8259A interrupt actually escapes to the CPU somehow and is handled
|    as an ExtINTA interrupt.  This would make the code in check_timer()  
|    decide it has found a working configuration, while actually it has been
|    fooled.

Maciej, that is why we get 'received illegal vector'?

| 
| 2. There is a bug in this patch or an assumption it makes which results 
|    in the state of some component not to be restored correctly.  
|    Unfortunately I have no resources to test the 64-bit variation of the 
|    code, so something may have escaped my attention.
| 
|  I'd like to find out which one is the case -- can you please reapply the
| patch and send me the corresponding section of the bootstrap log?  If the
| system hangs before you can retrieve the log, please just place:
| 
| while (1);
| 
| or something like that after the out: label in check_timer().
| 
|  Thanks.
