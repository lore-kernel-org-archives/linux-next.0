The ISA bus space is non-discoverable so that doesn't make any sense.

x86 has an internal invisible IRQ 0 on some platforms. It's never exposed
beyond the arch code.

Actually it would be about ten minutes work to remap it to some other
number that isn't used. It never goes via request_irq or via any core or
driver layer code however.

In the ARM case the same is going to be true. If you have IRQ 0 plumbing
that only goes internally in the arch/arm code - eg an ARM with IRQ 0
wired to something totally arch specific and non-driver then it's not
going to break and like the internals of x86 doesn't matter.

Pity you feel that way, but if ARM wants to continue to break more and
more as we clean up NO_IRQ for everything else that's your privilege, but
don't expect any sympathy.
