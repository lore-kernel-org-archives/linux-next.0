Yes, this looks like the latest version. As far as I remember I didn't
get feedback on it and had not time to work further on the patch.

There are also problems with building a generic linux-tools package. One
is that the packages need to look differently for Debian and Ubuntu. The
other problem is that it may break automated x-compile builds.
