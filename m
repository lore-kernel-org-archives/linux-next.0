Well, as I pointed out in reply that nobody will see to the buildbots:

There is something off in this report... I cannot reproduce.  It is
almost like the warning was generated when building an older version of
this change, but then reported against the latest commit.

I switched to sector_div() specifically because of the undefined
__udivdi3 error.

So I'm ignoring this given I cannot reproduce when using 'make ARCH=i386'
