well, note that those patches will go away on the next auto-x86-next 
iteration, as they touch pure acpi code with no direct x86 component. 
Please keep track of them separately.

Note that there's about half a dozen other potential bugs i've already 
fixed in -tip and which are in various stages of getting propagated to 
other trees. You might want to start tracking tip/out-of-tree, that's a 
laundry list of (sometimes questionable) convenience fixes and hacks.

( If you start tracking tip/out-of-tree: i'm willing to drop any patch
  in there in favor of an existing better fix [even if that fix is not 
  well-tested], but i'm not willing to drop anything in there on the 
  pure grounds of it crossing maintenance boundaries. I need those fixes 
  for -tip testing - and they cross maintenance boundaries, that's why 
  it's called tip/out-of-tree - it's fixes not covered by the topics in 
  -tip itself. )

I've Cc:-ed Len. The recap, there was a pre-existing ACPI build problem, 
which was made more prominent via this change:

|    x86: add SRAT parsing to 64-bit
|
|    parse the SRAT on 64-bit unconditionally.

as that ACPI build problem now triggers an an allmodconfig x86 64-bit 
build. Would be nice if Len could have a look and pick up (or NAK/fix) 
the two patches below from Russ Anderson and me. The ia64 fix is there 
because ia64 really wants to do SRAT parsing to be bootable.

    acpi: acpi numa init build fix
    
    x86.git testing found the following build error on latest -git:
    
     drivers/acpi/numa.c: In function 'acpi_numa_init':
     drivers/acpi/numa.c:226: error: 'NR_NODE_MEMBLKS' undeclared (first use in this function)
     drivers/acpi/numa.c:226: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
     drivers/acpi/numa.c:226: error: for each function it appears in.)
    
    with this config:
    
     http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/config-Wed_Apr_30_22_42_42_CEST_2008.bad
    
    i suspect we dont want SRAT parsing when CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_PARSE_SRAT
    is unset - but the fix looks a bit ugly. Perhaps we should define
    NR_NODE_MEMBLKS even in this case and just let the code fall back
    to some sane behavior?
