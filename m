I'm quite sure it's your patch, so I'm going to drop it for now.  Note
that with ext3, we don't have flex_bg's (the flex_bg size is 1).

Here's a reliable repro:

	kvm-xfstests --no-log -c ext3 generic/003

(In fact a huge number of tests fail using the ext3 configuration, but
generic/003 is a quick fast test.  Before submitting patches, please
run at the very least "kvm-xfstests smoke".  Admittedly, for this bug
the smoke test wouldn't have been enough.  You would have needed
"kvm-xfstests-g quick", or preferably, "kvm-xfstests -g auto".
Alternatively, you can use gce-xfstests, which uses Google Compute
Engine where you can just fire off the tests, and it will send you
e-mail with the test results.  See
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/fs/ext2/xfstests-bld.git/tree/kvm-xfstests/README.GCE
for more information.)
