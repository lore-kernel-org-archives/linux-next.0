In the list it was agreed that the patchset goes via arm-soc tree.

Above are the correct git object for which I sent pull request for.

The above git object don't exist in my tree so am not sure about these
objects. I Just checked Rafael's pm-domains head and that also don't
have these objects.

See above. The one in arm-soc tree is what I sent as pull request. Am
also confused for the git objects you pointed out in pm/pm-domains.
If they are not on the source pm-domains tree then how they landed
up in linux-next ?
