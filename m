I also ran into this and immediately came to look in the linux-next
e-mail discussions, since I was sure this had to be widespread...

...but I think this misses the point completely.  I have my queue of patches
that I regularly test against the daily linux-next.  I have no interest at this
point in time about the gcc plugins.  I just want to fetch linux-next, apply
my patches and for a set of architectures, do an "allmodconfig" and build.

After the plugin commits, I can't even build the native (i386 and x86_64)
allmodconfig arch to build test my work.  And this is on a generic common
distro install.   People may not have admin access on their build machines
so you can't just say ...

...install the above packages.  Just like some of the other features with
dependencies, this needs to warn and self-disable,  It can't be breaking
existing work flows that people rely on.   An example of warn and continue:

Makefile:689: Cannot use CONFIG_KCOV: -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc is
not supported by compiler

I have locally reverted the three gcc-plugin commits so I can continue to
test my pending work on linux-next, but please do give the above some
consideration vs. forcing everyone else to do the same 3 reverts.

Thanks,
Paul.
