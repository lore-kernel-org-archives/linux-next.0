I have considered that but "grep -r FF_MEMLESS" returned no other
driver using "depend" so I decided to use "select", too.

Why? It is a really small feature that depends only on CONFIG_INPUT.
Just 600 lines of code. I don't see why someone who wants to enable
the way bigger wiimote driver and HID core would bother about
=46F_MEMLESS? Why should someone want to disable the rumble-feature of
the wiimote?
I cannot see any real use-case here. Maybe you can explain a bit more.
