=2E.. for struct usb_device_id.
But not for all other existing and future device ID types.

We have kernel_ulong_t to tell the host compiler what the target's
unsigned long type (actually only its size, not alignment) is.

scripts/mod/file2alias.c handles this with:

#if KERNEL_ELFCLASS =3D=3D ELFCLASS32
typedef Elf32_Addr      kernel_ulong_t;
#define BITS_PER_LONG 32
#else
typedef Elf64_Addr      kernel_ulong_t;
#define BITS_PER_LONG 64
#endif

To fix the misalignment issue, can't we add
"__attribute__((aligned(2)))" to the typedef when cross-compiling for m=
68k?

Still, that only solves the problem for "kernel_ulong_t". Not for all o=
ther
4 or 8 bytes types (in practice just "u32") that are used in
include/linux/mod_devicetable.h. So we would also need "kernel_u32".
And "kernel_u16" for consistency.
