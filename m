Yes, I agree.
Anyway, given the fact that video.ko was rather broken all the time, a 
reasonable solution for now is to exclude Dells from using it.

The dcdbas driver writers (I expect Dell itself has its finger on this one) 
should get informed and solution will be found. video_detect.c probably will 
help here.
