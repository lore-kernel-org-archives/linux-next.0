I don't really believe in luck :-)  I think someone has been really

This feels a lot like papering over the real problem.  It will solve
this instance, but the list of such previous "paper work" that Geert
provided should be enough evidence that this will happen again the next
time someone modifies a device id struct for some subsystem.

And adding forced aligment here feels wrong since there is no good
reason why the (target) compiler shouldn't know the proper alignment fo=
r
this structure, is there? OK, "feels wrong" is not a good argument. But
it would be better to solve this problem once and for all.

AFAIK (which admittedly is not much wrt cross building) there is no way
we can make the host built file2alias know the proper aligment for the
structure in the target built modules.  That's the background for this
fix:=20

    kbuild: soften modpost checks when doing cross builds
   =20
    The module alias support in the kernel have a consistency
    check where it is checked that the size of a structure
    in the kernel and on the build host are the same.
    For cross builds this check does not make sense so detect
    when we do cross builds and silently skip the check in these
    situations.
    This fixes a build bug for a wireless driver when cross building
    for arm.



What I'm now wondering is why didn't this kick in?  I believe we should
find and fix that instead of playing around with the in-kernel structur=
e
alignments.  If that's possible.

BTW, thanks for finding and reporting this at such an early stage,
Geert.
