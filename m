The problem I see here is that they are not necessarily equivalent.

In particular the function here is just a generic low level error
reporting function, but you really want to report the caller.
And that's a genuine wish. With your patch it would always
report the same function and only differ in the (potentially
unreliable) backtrace.

I think it would be better to provide a warn_on_slowpath() for
the !CONFIG_BUG case and drop this patch.

Not-Acked: ...
