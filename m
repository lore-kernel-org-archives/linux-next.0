And now there is, so...

No I didn't. Please don't do this - we have all the code needed to do it 
properly, so there's no need to use the thinkpad_acpi driver for 
backlight control on this hardware.

We can't. There's no way of telling whether the OS is capable of 
opregion video support until the drm module has been loaded, and any 
BIOS is going to have done its OSI checks at boot time.

The spec doesn't require an OSI string for this. Firmware that wants to 
know whether the OS is able to respond to opregion requests should do so 
by checking the specced opregion flags that the OS will set when it 
loads the driver.
