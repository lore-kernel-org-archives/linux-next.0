Bummer, my fault (commit e9cc8bddaea3944fabfebb968bc88d603239beed,
netlink: Move netlink attribute parsing support to lib).

Obviously I was only worried about crypto/zlib.c needing nlattr.c
without pulling in the whole networking code, not about nlattr.c
itself needing networking functionality. But still, how could I have
missed this compile failure?

Does it sound sane to protect the routines that do call skb_put() by
#ifdef CONFIG_NET?
