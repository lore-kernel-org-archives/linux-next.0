I checked them all and they all do.

Besides for the ACPI case we only have to care about x86 and ia64.

But all do it anyways.

I think warn_on_slow_path() should be a general interface.
Perhaps with a better name though.

But it's in kernel/panic.c. I don't think anyone can compile
without that. So it should be always there (unless you undefine CONFIG_BUG)

Well not defining CONFIG_BUG means "I don't care about debugging" doesn't it?
Not having (or having only crippled) ACPI debugging in that case seems reasonable

Doesn't seem that arbitrary to me.

Ok we can just rename warn_on_slow_path() which is already there to that new name.
Would that satisfy you?

I think the reason for the warn_on_slowpath() is that it produces
patterns that can be detected by Arjan's kerneloops scripts.

I'm not sure manual printk/dump_stack would have the same effect.
