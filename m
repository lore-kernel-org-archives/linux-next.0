Who should set that flags?
The dri driver is going to set that if he can serve IGD parts, right?
I am going to figure out whether your DRI parts, video.ko only or vendor 
specific acpi drivers are going to serve backlight switching.

Currently this patch makes the vendor specific e.g. thinkpad_acpi to serve 
backlight brightness switching if a IGD device is found. Because currently 
there is no IGD support in the kernel.

What is needed is code that runs before module load time and checks for BIOS 
support and then decides whether video.ko or thinkpad_acpi, sony_acpi, 
whatever_can_do_backlight.ko is going to do it. This is in fact what this 
whole patch is about.

You should export a function intel_opregion_init()? so that built in kernel 
parts can check for IGD backlight support, instead of the lines above (part 
of my patch). If this succeeds, my patch will tell vendor specfic drivers to 
keep fingers off backlight switching.

In the dri parts you directly map to the memory instead of using ACPI Field 
names. While a specification might state that the ACPI name should be TCHE, 
it should be checked before module load time the same way as you do it in the 
dri parts.
