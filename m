Okay, thanks for clarifying.

I don't get this one. Yes, they are of perpetual nature, so how could we
remove them from the kernel tree?

What I am afraid of is: tentative solutions tend to stay, because the
need for a proper solution is reduced. Yet, finding proper generic
bindings might take some time which doesn't meet the high pressure
around DT at the moment.
