The git clone you have done will just get the master branch,
and put it in a directory named fix-includes.

Which is ok, but you still won't have the "fix-includes" branch.
Do this after the clone:

   git pull 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gerg/m68knommu.git 
fix-includes

Regards
Greg
