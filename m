Makes sense. OK. I want to help here with a complete fix but it has been a 
while since I have waded into SPI and ARM initialization so here are some 
stumbling blocks for me.

If I first fix the build issue by adding 'int gpio_num' to the 
pcap_platform_data and made use of pdata->gpio_num in place of irq_to_gpio() 
in pcap_isr_work().  Now to set gpio_num.

In the board .c file I would assume the goal would be to create the necessary 
structs to set gpio_num for "ezx-pcap" and pass them to 
spi_register_board_info(). Right? But should I expect to already see some of 
this infrastructure in place already? Doesn't the "ezx-pcap" device already 
have to be defined somewhere, to have irq_base set for example? Or is this 
coming from firmware?

Thanks,
Mark A.
