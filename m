Thanks, that's the right fix as that header won't be needed any longer
as we've made omap4 device tree only.

The earlier mailbox branch was merged into arm-soc for a few weeks until
we decided to drop it as Jassi is working on a more generic API. That was
merged in commit 51b5f893, then reverted in commit b5c85186. The updated
mailbox branch accounts for the generic API coming up from Jassi.

Suman, can you please check if Linux next has mailbox related files merged
correctly?

Yes omap_control_usb.h is no longer needed either.

Thanks,
