The commit in question (1efa3bb79d3 "dm: must allocate dm_noclone for
stacked noclone devices") conditionally allocates the 'struct
dm_noclone' and I can only infer that the change is causing a negative
side-effect in virtualized environments (both x86_64 and s390).

I haven't been able to reproduce on x86_64 kvm with virtio-scsi on
fedora 25 though.  Will try fedora 29 shortly, and also try virtio-blk.

Could you please provide your guest's .config (even if just off-list)?
Also, what kernel are you running on the host?

Thanks,
Mike
