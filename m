Hi,

I observe the following build error while building uImage for ARM.

  Kernel: arch/arm/boot/Image is ready
make[2]: *** No rule to make target
`arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux.lds', needed by
`arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 2
make: *** [uImage] Error 2

Regards,
Sachin.
