Can these two go to linux-next or -mm, pls.
If they got some testing, maybe it's even possible to still queue them
for 2.6.27?

Be aware that they depend on a patch that got queued up for 2.6.27 in
the ACPI tree:
Subject: fix brightness allocation
By: Julia Jomantaite <julia.jomantaite@gmail.com>

Both are compile tested.


Before I adjusted them a bit to Julia's patch and reordered the functions a 
bit I tested them on a Lenovo T61 with an internal Intel Graphics card with 
IGD BIOS support and a T61 with a Nvidida card.
In both cases the correct ACPI graphics device is used and brightness worked 
out of the box.

ACPI: video: Ignore devices that aren't present in hardware

This is a reimplemention of commit
0119509c4fbc9adcef1472817fda295334612976
from Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>

This patch got removed because of a regression: ThinkPads with a
Intel graphics card and an Integrated Graphics Device BIOS implementation
stopped working.
In fact, they only worked because the wrong ACPI device  
was used (via int10). So ACPI functions were poking on the wrong
hardware which is a sever bug.
The next patch provides support for above ThinkPads to be able to
switch brightness via the legacy thinkpad_acpi driver and automatically
detect when to use it.

Original commit message from Matthew Garrett:
    Vendors often ship machines with a choice of integrated or discrete
    graphics, and use the same DSDT for both. As a result, the ACPI video
    module will locate devices that may not exist on this specific platform.
    Attempt to determine whether the device exists or not, and abort the
    device creation if it doesn't.
