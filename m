Yup.  That's actually just building exactly what "tilegx" would build by default.

I'm not sure who builds the toolchains, but tilepro is in upstream gcc/binutils/etc
so should be easy enough to include.  There's also a cross-toolchain for x64 I put
up a while ago [1] that you could grab if you wanted to try it.
