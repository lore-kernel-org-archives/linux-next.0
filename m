I must be missing something. After the PTE is changed, but before the
secondary TLB notification/invalidation - What prevents another thread =
from
changing the mappings (e.g., using munmap/mmap), and setting a new page
at that PTE?

Wouldn=E2=80=99t it end with the page being mapped without a secondary =
TLB flush in
between?
