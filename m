We could do that, but I'd rather do it in full.

I think it would be okay to take the 3 patches due for the v3.6 merge=20
window, which target the nmk-i2c driver. If any consolidation happens i=
n=20
the mean-time/future I will personally do the work to bring the nmk-i2c=
=20
into line to use any generic bindings which result.

No one else is ever going to use these vendor specific bindings, so I'm=
=20
sure no issues will arise. It also means that we have a fully enabled=20
driver which is capable of receiving a new configuration via minor=20
changes to the dts, which is important for the current (only) user of=20
this driver for an upcoming project.
