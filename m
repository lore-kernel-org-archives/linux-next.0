No. The opregion spec requires you to use video.ko.

Yes, but that's *wrong*. There are many machines that support opregion 
but do not require its use - they'll behave using the old ACPI mechanism 
until you switch them to the new mode. Except right now if you switch 
them to the new mode then they'll stop working, because the DRI code 
isn't merged yet.

No. Please read the opregion spec. The way it works is as follows:

1) Firmware exports an ACPI video class
2) OS checks whether the hardware supports the opregion ACPI video 
handling (this is done by looking at tables in a region of memory 
pointed at by a PCI configuration register)
3) OS sets opregion flags
4) OS calls the ACPI backlight set function
5) Firmware writes desired brightness to an opregion mailbox and 
triggers an interrupt
6) OS sets the brightness

For this to work, the ACPI video driver needs to work as it currently 
does. It is not correct for it to disable itself on IGD systems.
