I'm not at all convinced that this patch has anything to do with your
problem.  I don't see how it could affect things, and I believe you
mentioned that you saw the problem even with this patch applied?  (I'm
not sure; some of your messages which you sent were hard to
understand, and you mentioned something about trying to send messages
when low on sleep :-).

In any case, the reason why I haven't pulled this patch into the ext4
tree is because I was waiting for Eric and some of the performance
team folks at Red Hat to supply some additional information about why
this commit was making a difference in performance for a particular
proprietary, closed source benchmark.

I'm very suspicious about applying patches under the "cargo cult"
school of programming.  ("We don't understand why it makes a
difference, but it seems to be good, so bombs away!" :-)
