What's the difference?

The Device Tree describes the hardware (hardware =3D=3D silicon +=20
peripherals). So different platforms are different pieces of hardware.=20
Everything the driver can't figure itself out from the silicon itself=20
needs to be described in the DT.

We can describe the relationship with a hierarchical layout of the dts=20
and dtsi files. So for my recent venture we have:

We also have plans to split it up further:
