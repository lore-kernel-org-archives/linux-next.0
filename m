I agree with what you say to some extent, but I believe that it is more=
=20
important to have a working solution now than to ensure that each=20
bindings are as unique as possible. After any suggestion of=20
consolidation, a move from vendor specific to generically defined Devic=
e=20
Tree bindings is trivial. Especially in the current stage where=20
adaptions and definitions are still fluid.

Obviously some care is taken to ensure the bindings are as generic as=20
possible, but not to the extent that will put the project back some=20
months. Over past few months I have enabled many sub-systems; however, =
I=20
think it would have been a fraction of that if we'd gone through the=20
laborious process of immediate forced consolidation. I think it's fine=20
to have platform/vendor specific bindings that work, then come back to=20
unify them once the dust settles.

If you know of any bindings which you know are generic, I'm happy to=20
define and swap them out for the ones I've proposed, but due to a chang=
e=20
of project focus I can't afford to spend hours studying all of the=20
drivers to match-up possible unifications.

Kind regards,
Lee
