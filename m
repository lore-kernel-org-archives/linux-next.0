You weren't ignored.  Mimi responded and mentioned a subsequent patch, 
after which, there was no further discussion.

I've reverted:

b89e66e1e396f7b5436af154e58209320cc08aed
"TPM: ACPI/PNP dependency removal"

a674fa46c79ffa37995bd1c8e4daa2b3be5a95ae
"ima: remove ACPI dependency"


Note: any further ACPI-related changes here should have acks from 
linux-acpi folk.
