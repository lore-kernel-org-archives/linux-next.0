Part of the driver has been exported to the SCSI tree already (the software and
broadcam iSCSI one). The only two remainig pieces are the SysFS skeleton
(which should probably still sit in drivers/firmware) and iBFT finder.

The remaining piece that could be moved to drivers/acpi is the "finder" of
the IBFT which can find it via ACPI, similar to how MADT tables are found
(so perhaps arch/x86/acpi?).

The trick is that we also have to retain the code functionality if
"# CONFIG_ACPI is not set" to scan the memory for the iBFT. That part
should definitly _not_ be moved to drivers/acpi. It could be moved to
arch/x86/ .. but it could also stay in drivers/firmware. <shrugs>
