The irq_set_parent() is required for proper supporting of lazy irq disabling
for threaded nested irqs and allow them to be re-triggered in the following case:

driverX:
 disable(nested_irq);
...
 parent irq triggered
   |- handle_nested_irq()
	|- mark nested_irq with IRQS_PENDING

...
driverX:
 enable(nested_irq);
   |- if IRQS_PENDING -> resend parent_irq [*], because nested threaded irq can't
      be resend by itself 

[*] if parent_irq is not set the IRQS_PENDING status will be ignored and irq might be lost.

Also, it was "mandatory" to be done before commit 75a06189fc5 
"genirq: Prevent resend to interrupts marked IRQ_NESTED_THREAD"
which made setting of parent_irq optional.

So, if is it required or not depends not only on HW, but, rather, on MFD drivers implementation
(Interrupt controller and MFD cell drivers).
