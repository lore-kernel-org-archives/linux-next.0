on i386:

drivers/edac/i82975x_edac.c:298: warning: integer constant is too large for 'unsigned long' type

which is:

	if (info->xeap & 1)
		page |= 0x100000000ul; <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

but page is unsigned long (32 bits), while 0x100000000ul is more than 32 bits,
so that line isn't setting a bit in <page>.  Is it a bug, or this driver isn't
applicable to X86_32, or what?


thanks,
