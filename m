The chip is a cortex-m3 or something like that. What makes the LEDs
work in this specific way this driver uses is the firmware on the chip,
and that firmware is specific for Omnia.

It is possible that in the future someone makes a I2C controller
compatible with the API the Omnia firmware provides, but very unlikely.

I think it is reasonable to make the driver depend on MACH_ARMADA_38X
and in the unlikely scenario that someone makes a compatible
controller, the dependency can always be removed.
